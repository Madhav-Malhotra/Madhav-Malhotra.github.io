### What I Learned
- I've been thinking about the serenity prayer: **"God grant me the serenity to accept what I cannot change, the courage to change what I can, and the wisdom to tell the difference."**
  - In my own life, I feel like I haven't been very wise recently. I feel like I've been caught up in repeating cycles of mistakes that I should have moved past. This prayer helps me think about the tiny habits I keep on repeating since they're on autopilot for me without taking a step back to ask if they make sense. 
  - Ex: One thing I've identified is when I really wish I had someone to trust deeply, spend all my energy into creating that kind of connection with one person, and then being disappointed when that doesn't go according to plan because putting all my trust in one person isn't very realistic. In response to that, I can think about the serenity prayer and pull myself out of autopilot to think about whether I'm doing something sensible. The part I haven't yet figured out is how to do that while not losing my brightness or vivacity. Neither being desolately detached nor precariously elated seem like a good way to walk through life. 
- I've been thinking about what to make of life. Is it a chance to grow? Is it simply an experience to experience? Is it a new horizon to explore? It seems theoretical to phrase things that way, but what I'm tangibly wondering is what weight to put on which goals in life. Right now, I'm young and capable of adjusting how much I spend my time travelling, pursuing technical growth, reflecting on personal/spiritual growth, etc. It's unclear what to choice to take in that.

### What I Did
- Was there for someone struggling with loneliness when they needed me. Most of the things I did this term will fade. Though that'll matter. I think of what Samuel Beckett had to say in Waiting for Godot: ""Let us do something, while we have the chance! It is not every day that we are needed. Not indeed that we personally are needed. Others would meet the case equally well, if not better. **To all mankind they were addressed, those cries for help still ringing in our ears! But at this place, at this moment of time, all mankind is us, whether we like it or not.**"" 
- Wrapped up my last standup comedy performance, AI workshop, and debate tournament. I learned a bunch and I'm glad I carved time out for those side quests this term. I feel a lot more at home on stage and I feel a lot more at home being asked to justify my opinions on any topic. I'm glad I gave some time to be of service to others.
- Organised my research assistantship with Professor Andrew Boutros with a formal research proposal. We'll be working on improving FPGA placement algorithms' runtime with RL. I appreciated the process since Professor Boutros just gave me a problem to think about and I had the freedom to approach it with whatever hypothesis I wanted. It was a good investigative process and I'll look forward to reporting the results of our work over the coming months. 
- Finished my university courses and starting the exams grind. I only like my [stats course - notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1J0uRUBNyN_HH5jPBy6UEwaVZCJTlFROR), though at least all the other extracurricular experiments this term were worth it :-)
- Prepping for the move to Japan. If anyone wants to learn Japanese, I found Pimsleur's Japanese Basics course useful. They skip the confusing character-by-character writing and jump into learning phrases with everyday utility first.
