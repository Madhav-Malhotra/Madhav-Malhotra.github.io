### What I Learned
- I was rewatching this video on Hank Green on [what to do when your passion runs out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK3i69FCobI). It makes me think about the value of humour. Today, I was very annoyed about some unfunny government bureaucracy for VISAs. If I just kept thinking about that all day, I'd be beyond miserable. Being able to laugh at the absurdity of everything and the path that led me here helps me continue onwards and explore.
  - A very different helpful way to approach this is to think about how I can just reset in any given moment. Here's how Sam Harris explains this: ""The whole point of life is not to arrive, but to begin again. Because everything you've done or not done is now just a memory. And everything you're telling yourself about the future is a half-truth at best. Because however good, or bad, things seem, nothing lasts... So wherever you've come from, however hard things have seemed, whoever is in your life or no longer in it, whatever has been done or left undone, just begin again.""
- There are some people that are very good at debating. They will point out flaws in my reasoning and persuasively change even simple, common-sense beliefs. This does not always mean that the debaters are helping 'open my mind' or make me a 'better thinker'. Sometimes, the **debaters will succeed in changing my common-sense belief... only for me to see that common sense was indeed the right belief**. More information does not necessarily mean better decisions. As an example, I recently discovered this [very poorly aged debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTnV5RfhIjk) where Ben Shapiro was excellent at debating and providing plausible-sounding counterarguments - that turned out to be very untrue one year down the line.

### What I Did
- Finished exams and my last term in Waterloo for a while. When it comes to this transition from studying to internship, I've been thinking about how I have to 'set up' a good lifestyle as I get older. I have more and more freedom to simply stay in the house all day and code. If I don't make the decision to get in habits of exercising, volunteering, etc. - I can easily hurt myself with the freedom I have.
- I've spent more hours than I can count on making this [4 hour intro to RL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf0X3Y287uQ). I learned how to use claude code to make presentations, which is what allowed me to make the 130 slides required for it :O If anyone's attempting a major presentation or video, would recommend this intro to [claude code for prsentations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG7RI44FytY).
- Started my job remotely and currently awaiting a VISA. It would be nice to join the rest of the team in Japan. Reflecting on the first few weeks, my boss, Satwik, has been very helpful in making time to answer the many questions I've had.
