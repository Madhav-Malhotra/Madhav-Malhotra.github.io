### What I Learned
- I feel like I've been caught up with short-term attention-grabbing activities in the last month. The world's chaos seemed like it was urgent to check in on, even when there was nothing I could do to alter any of the events. One day, I decided to just stop and I was a lot happier because of it. An interesting related concept I learned about from a podcast is the 'half life' of information (how long information is relevant for). **If something isn't relevant a week from now (majority of 'the news'), why bother putting my attention to it?** 
- Everyone I've ever met that's learned engineering concepts has learned them as instrumental goals (milestones to something else). To put it simply, whenever I've asked someone **"You could do anything you want 5 minutes from now with no external pressures. What would you do?"** People have said they'd spend time in nature, play sports, listen to music, spend time with people they care about, ... No one's ever said they'd analyse poles/zeros in a root-locus graph. Sure, there are lots of engineers who like their jobs. I've never met one that would say they'd work on an engineering concept 5 minutes from now just because they like engineering concepts. Though I have met lawyers who'd want to think about ethical arguments, therapists who'd want to listen to others' challenges, artists who'd like to explore art, etc. 
- I've become a lot more okay with going with the flow recently as I start to realise just how lost I am. Let's say I ask myself, "What does a good life look like?" My answers are like asking a colonial explorer what's at the edge of the world when they don't realise the world is round. The explorer might say there are monsters or otherworldly dimensions and I might say a good life has creativity and people I care for, but our lives are so far from the truth that our theories make no difference. It then makes a bunch of sense to just focus on putting one foot in front of the other, doing one experiment at a time, and waiting to see what we learn as we progress.

### What I Did
- A lot of time spent on midterm exams, university labs, and the like. I can now say that I have wasted over 100 hours over the course of my life due to problems in C pointers :O - Getting more comfortable with functional programming as I learn how a cache is made. 
- Fiddling with people management at my design team (hiring practices, onboarding practices, and fun side projects like getting merch for the first time). I really like experimenting with organisational psychology. 
- Did my second standup performance ever. Lot more comfortable on stage now and I plan to have another go next month :-) 
- I have an exciting capstone project idea, though I'll only say it publicly once I've confirmed team members who want to make it come to life with me ;-) Suffice it to say, the game Overcooked is a great way to learn about lots of life's problems :D
