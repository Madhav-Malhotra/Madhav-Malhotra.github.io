### What I Learned
- I joined a debate club because I thought it would teach me to think critically. Turns out that wasn't at all correct. Competitive debate clubs are just about spewing forth as many points as you can in X minutes while learning nothing from listening to the opposing argument. Pretty boring and not the best way to learn to think about difficult questions
- I'm pretty uncertain about the future of the world and my place in it. On the one hand, that creates a lot of anxiety. "Where to live? Where to work? What to do?" On the other hand, it'd be pretty boring to have a stable life over 40 years where it's the same thing happening day in day out. In the grand scheme of things, at least I'll have interesting stories to tell by the time I die. **More phases of life give me more to compare and appreciate. One positive reinterpretation of chaos** :D
- Started doing LeetCode again after a while. Also programming manually in class again. It's more programming than I've done in a long time. **Realised the value of forcing myself to do the basics from scratch** instead of relying on AI tools to do everything for me. No matter whether 'AI takes X job', it's causing BIG problems with the ability to go from junior to experienced in any job.
- At 22, I've finally gotten to the point in life where I have to start filtering for things to NOT do instead of trying to find SOMETHING to do. RE: what I spend my time learning, where I work, etc. Checkpoint to remember when I need to give advice to my brother or if I have kids :D

### What I Did
- Started a new university term. Learning about statistics, computer networks, CPU architecture, and compilers. I thought a few courses were too simplistic, so I negotiated with the prof to get more sessions on industry-relevant tools :D
- Working on finding a job for next term and also trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I'm very lucky to have multiple options and people from the biggest companies in the world are happy to talk to give advice. Still, the question remains. What would I enjoy? What would I be good at? What does the world need?
  - It's always a happy surprise to see how some of the busiest people in the world are willing to take time out of their day to help a random student. One of the few things that makes me hopeful that humanity isn't just like the news makes it out to be.
- Started a [series of workshops](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqgr5FD_y_wKuCi7ZHNFQewXlV1TbBbPS) on machine learning. Thought it would be my way to give back to the university before I graduate
