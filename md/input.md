### What I Learned
- A good way to kickstart my progress in being a better person is to change my environment more often. When I moved back on campus, it was like an easy delineation from 'before' vs. 'after.' So it was easy to convince myself that I'll improve my exercise, sleep, reflections, etc. all of a sudden. **It'll be useful to ask how I can continue forcing myself to change environments every X months once I graduate.**
- I've had the great privilege of trying a lot of different life experiences (via travel, internships, extracurriculars, etc.). When I was younger, my general goal was to do as many different things as possible. Renaissance mindset. Having tried a bunch of things now, the picture is more nuanced. There's a right way to try a lot of things (embracing continuous learning) and a wrong way (drifting to stave off boredom). Especially when it comes to my education and career, I've seen a lot more that it's very easy to not have a certain minimum depth of knowledge to make useful contributions to the world. To that end, my current general goal is not about working in one career, then the next, then the next. It's about being good at what I uniquely do. Not being replaceable
- Learned a bunch about Roman history randomly :D Would recommend the playlist from [Historia Civilis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9qlNBBoFG4&list=PLODnBH8kenOrjXjWy7Hhkz9uOpZ3NTAow). Following this, I think I finally have some concept in my mind when I think of the word "institution." In the past, it just seemed like a bland, dimensionless word. Now, I'd say the word means 'backbone' but at the level of a society. For an individual, their literal, physical backbone (spine) is essential for them to do anything (social, economic, spiritual, etc.). No one says that their backbone is why they met a new friend at a club. Though it's orders of magnitude harder to meet a new friend at a club if you don't have a healthy backbone. Institutions serve the same purpose as an individual's backbone, but at a societal level. No one says that a fair legal system, trustworthy banking system, or transparent political system is the reason why citizens are happier, wealthier, etc. Though without these things, citizens will find it orders of magnitude harder to be happier, wealthier, etc.

### What I Did
- Started a new term and a research positiion at university. 
  - Currently learning about CPU architecture and coherency. Quantum physics and functional programming is also really rattling my head :D 
  - I'm in my third year and getting to the point where I have to start making decisions about the next phase of life. At the start, it's daunting since there's a bunch of decisions to make on where to live, whether to study, whether to work, what I like, ... Though it also frees some clutter since I can say no to more hassles. When I have to get my life in order, frivolities like rental squabbles or course grades are easy to ignore. 
  - Also in this phase of university, it feels like time to 'give back'. Made a [video on university tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqXM8YiYIiY) for anyone starting that journey.
- Having fun crossing off the aspirational for-later todos at my design team! Organised a standup comedy performance as a social and team merch after leaving these things for months to years.
