### What I Learned
- Self-help books have this term that I don't like called 'self-full'. It's supposed to be the opposite of 'selfish' but they don't really define it, nor is it common enough to be understood by most people. So I replace that term with 'sturdy.' Being 'sturdy' is about not just getting by, but doing well in a way that makes me a good foundation for the world around me. Ways to be sturdy include: 
  - Working towards healthy goals like better exercice, diet, or sleep.
  - Creating regular time to do things I enjoy that aren't trying to pull my attention into them. Examples: Rollerskating, drawing. Antiexamples: Youtube, TV shows.
  - Knowing my fears well enough to understand that voice in my head that tries to hold me back from them. Not just well enough to notice and dismiss that voice. Well enough to understand where it's coming from.
  - Regularly trying new experiments in life, like meeting new people, joining clubs/associations/fellowships/..., travelling to new areas, etc. 
- When I have a clearly-defined goal, I can get very easily sucked into one step, then the next, then the next without pausing. The usual way this causes problems is that I don't stop to reflect on the situation I'm in and whether I could be better progressing towards my goal in some other way. Ex: Not stopping to reflect on whether I've found the right job to accept instead of just thinking that I've found a job to accept. Though it also applies to smaller moments, like getting tunnel vision on fixing a software bug so I can render a video without pausing to realise I can just use a different software to get the render done more quickly. 
  - One thing that might help is to have a timer running during my work sessions so I have something to forcibly interrupt me to stop and reflect.

### What I Did
- Drove 3000km to the Arctic Ocean. [Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxKCblszqs4). Learned a lot more about how to create good drone photography. I'd recommend this [intro to camera settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r33iwr0nrjU&pp=0gcJCYUJAYcqIYzv) as a guide.
- Wrapped up my internship at Analyst3.ai. It was a fun experience where I was jumping around a lot of different technical areas, whether it was allowing AI models to stream responses on a frontend web app, creating AI agents to research financial data with backend job queues, or deploying everything to the web with Microsoft Azure.
- Set up the next cohort of teams for my design team, WAT.ai. Stepped back from technical work to organise the team's finances and get new sponsors. Also thinking about how I'm now old and need to train the next generation to take the reins :D 
- Visited some refugees I met on an adventure to Vancouver. They're making great progress since they've both found jobs and are planning to get married soon :-) Their [dog is also as cute as ever](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fxx1Xu3wR7XB_P_4gcpH3JGKGw21JX3G/view?usp=sharing)
