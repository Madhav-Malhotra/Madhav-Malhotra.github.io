### What I Learned
- **To dream is a privilege**. Some people struggle so much just to be able to walk. Some people are stuck in a cycle of poor health implies low autonomy implies low ability to make money implies poor health. I shouldn't take it for granted that I'm able to set goals and imagine a better future for myself. “Not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness."" - Morgan Housel. 
- I think **desensitisation to pain is just a mechanism to keep on going.** Usually, we talk about it in a context where it's a lack of compassion for others in hard circumstances. Though what I've experienced is that I can become desensitised to my own pain. After feeling bad long enough, there seems to be no point in feeling bad anymore. On the one hand, it doesn't seem like a great way to live. On the other hand, it's a survival mechanism to keep going on when it feels like there's no reason to.
- The main problem with never worrying about money is it literally doesn't make sense to do hard things. Why work hard when there's a low probability chance you end up better than well and a high probability chance you end off worse than well? Compare that to someone who isn't financially secure. There's a high probability chance you end off a little worse or similarly and a low probability chance you end off better. Some people treat this as an permanent attribute of a person, but it's more like a temporary state. People can worry vs. not worry about money in different periods in life. In my experience, both of these periods in my life had reasons to be unhappy, just different ones. The most interesting thing would be if someone with money voluntarily went back to a period without money, just to rekindle that fire to work hard at something.
- There's no difference in your happiness if you have a salary of $300,000/year vs. have a salary of $900,000/year. I know someone getting near the latter amount of money. They seem no different as a person than before.

### What I Did
- Confirmed that **I'll be working from Tokyo in my next job**. I'm very privileged to be 22 and not have to worry about supporting a family so I can make a decision like just moving to another country for 4 months without a bunch of worries.
- Finished midterms at my university. I unfortunately don't feel like I learned much this semester, somewhat due to my lack of focus in certain courses and somewhat due to poor course content.
- **Did my first debate tournament and got addicted to it** :D To amend my prior disparaging comments about debate - yes, it is just a bunch of people spewing forth points in a very non-persausive way of speaking. However, it isn't correct to say people aren't listening. In fact, it's 45+ minutes of sustained and intense listening to figure out different arguments noted, prioritise which ones are the most important, and then organise your contribution to the debate all at once. Some of the most realtime thinking I've done and it was very enjoyable :-)
- Continued working on [my workshop series for first year students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUiXM4EPtCM&list=PLqgr5FD_y_wKuCi7ZHNFQewXlV1TbBbPS). It's a way to ground me amidst the bubble of students around me heading to the biggest paychecks possible. Though I'd be lying if I said I'm not getting tired :D
