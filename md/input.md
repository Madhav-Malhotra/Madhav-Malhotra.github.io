### What I Learned
- Learned to value my family more after I fell ill for a while and really needed to stay at home and depend on their support. 
- To that end, good heatlh is prerequisite to a) a productive career, b) keeping up with education, c) meaningful social relationships, d) a comfortable family life, e) ... It's easy to underestimate how much it matters until it gives out on you.
- I've been thinking about what drives me and what I want to work towards in life. One thing I concluded was that a life without adventure doesn't seem well-lived to me. Adventure doesn't necessarily mean travelling, but it does mean newness and uniqueness. I don't see adventure in an around-the-world cruise. But it may be aventure to fly a handmade kite in a nearby park on a sunny afternoon. To me, adventure refers to those shocks that break me out of the routine in life. (Routine and adventure are both valuable, but it's easy to get routine in modern society while I have to try very intentionally to get adventure.)

### What I Did
- Published a paper on [how to evaluate chatbots for political analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xIML3Ii5arzFJQl_nign1Ne7teYdzIBh/view?usp=sharing). Also attended a conference for the first time. It was a lot of fun, including a [team dinner at the end](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xOw_8o4AUBW6kzR26v_I-j5JZb5JGEDB/view?usp=drive_link) with delegates I met from across Canada!
- Learned quite a bit from the fourth year capstone projects at my university! It's always my favourite time of the year, despite a few inconveniently-timed health issues :/ Video showcasing some cool projects coming soon. 
- Started preparing to head to the Yukon. It's a pretty big jump in terms of adventures since I didn't even know how to change a tire on a car before I started preparations this month :O
- Finished a course on electronic amplifiers. [Notes here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1CuvtGQd1jCrdGZINXAh47Psb3-XRD95q) if anyone's enough of a nerd to want to read them :D
- Learned about the Oauth protocol at work while developing some integrations with external softwares for clients. Also started developing headless browser automations to make financial transactions with some legacy sites. Pretty cool once you get everything working and you can watch your own little assistant using a computer to help you :D
