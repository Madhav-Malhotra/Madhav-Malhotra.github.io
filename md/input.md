### What I Learned
- We live in a society where I see someone overworked, miserable, exhausted, and without a social life just grinding from 7 AM to 7 PM every day. Their Linkedin says 'XYZ at ABC' while I'm just 'XY at AB' though. So I get in line for my turn to be in their place, even if I'm not fully sure if the extra letters on Linkedin are what you really want.

- I don't really need people to help me with hard things because they're hard. I'm just looking for people to tell me it'll be okay amidst the uncertainty. If I roll up my sleeves and get to work, I get more done in a couple of days than I have waiting weeks for others to give me permission for X,Y,Z
- "It isn't merely that your fate depends on whether or not you get your act together... the things you do, they're like dropping stones in a pond. The ripples move outward and they affect things in ways that you can't fully comprehend. And it means that the things that you do and that you don't do are far more important than you think!" - Jordan Peterson
- Started talking to my brother more personally after years of not doing so. There was nothing holding me back but this imaginary wall that appeared a castle till breached and a wispy remnant right after.

### What I Did
- Started working at an AI startup doing investment research. My boss is very nice. She plays to my strengths and I've been getting to do a lot of detail-oriented optimisation with prompt-engineering, batched evaluations, data quality refinement, etc. Here are some notes I took during onboarding on [Next.js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YEU16HdBCC3yw3XwhLvtZrpjrgX0iLwSyj3tPUDUm1E/edit?tab=t.0) and [Fast API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xI5jy9miwybUpPwjQHekw2_aq2Wtj3h3MfkgHytk3EU/edit?tab=t.0)
- Loving my design team [creating chatbots for political legislation analysis](https://github.com/Madhav-Malhotra/political-chatbot). I don't have to worry about anyone and things are just getting done! Finalised our experimental method and getting ready to collect our experimental results in February. 
- Stressed about my design team [creating a toy AI accelerator](https://github.com/Madhav-Malhotra/ml-accelerator-dataflows/). Really struggling to get things done while taking on others' work. Pushing through the discomfort and trying to create opportunities to learn new things when I get too demotivated by the grind.
- Gave a keynote to a high school conference about how to get started in AI. The speakers before me were a former finance minister and the CEO of Honda. I walked up and said: "You know, I was talking to my friend last night, wondering why I got invited to speak here. I don't have any of the credentials of the other speakers. She told me, 'Hey, you're the guy who's going to teach the kids how to get into university. You're the star of the show!'" That got a big laugh :D
- Really working at trying to make new friends and snap out of being complacent and waiting for others. As my economics teacher, Mr. Lam, told me, "Progress over perfection."
