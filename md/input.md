### What I Learned
- **Whether I say I feel lucky or unlucky, it's true**. This is because the 'feeling' changes how I act and the spontaneous opportunities I say 'yes' to. Just saying that I feel lucky, I'm more happy, outgoing, helpful, and calm during periods of stress.
- Just a reminder that the best people in the world at something are ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE better than average (or even good) people. I met a manager like that serendipitously on my flight to Japan and she completely [shifted my perspective on problems I'd been ignoring](https://www.madhavmalhotra.com/life-updates/#20260125-194421) for a while since it was easier emotionally than dealing with them. There are people who couldn't pay you enough money to work for them and then there's Lyna :O I'd pay to work for Lyna :D
- Learned that Japanese is a language with five different alphabets ;-; There's three phonetic alphabets (katakana, hiragana, and romaji). There's also two more alphabets where symbols correspond to words not sounds (kanji and ~~kanji extended~~ furigana). I gave up on learning to read myself :D Though at work, I get to think about how AI chatbots deal with all this mess. It's a really intriguing technical problem that I can't fully discuss due to confidentiality agreements.
- Learned to cook out of necessity in Japan :O As a vegan, I can't go out to most restaurants + my signature 'throw everything in a pot and pray' wasn't really palatable :D Now, I know tiny tricks that you only learn the hard way. Ex: How buckwheat noodles don't have gluten, which causes them to dissolve in water unlike pasta. Ex: How noodles clump when frozen for mealprep, so they need to be oiled beforehand.
- I'm not saying that Japanese babies are the cutest babies in the world. All I'm saying is that out of the babies I've seen, Japanese babies are the cutest babies in the world :D

### What I Did
- Had fun with my projects at work. I can't describe them for confidentiality, but I was positively surprised by the amount I got to work on meangingful projects that I was uniquely skilled for. My team has been very supportive in routing me interesting unsolved challenges. 
- Restarted my research assistantship and capstone after exams. It's exciting to be making progress on this again after having stopped for exams! The good and bad thing is that I have a lot of freedom to go as far as I want (or not). So I have to be responsible in using that well to put in consistent effort. Will share some visual demos next month!
- Arrived in Japan. Was very lucky to meet an incredible soul on the flight who helped me more than I can really put in words. Though I respectfully tried - [ongoing travel blog](https://www.madhavmalhotra.com/life-updates/#20260125-194421). Lyna and I had a deep talk for three hours on letting go of the past and growing. In honest, honest reflection - if I'd known how much the VISA process would have sucked, I would have decided to not come to Japan. And that would have been such a loss since I'd still be stuck in old grudges without that conversation with Lyna.
  - P.S. It was actually a really cool process to make the travel blog. I'll put up a video about it soon.
