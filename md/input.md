### What I Learned
- All it takes to start travelling the world is [the right passport and selling waffles in Switzerland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cNrCPKlEKY) :D
- There are many different ways people try to console others who are feeling heartbroken. The most common: "You'll find someone better." Not the best approach. It can dismiss how much the person you care about meant to you. My recommendation is to ask: "What did they mean to you? What do you miss?" It creates more space to feel what needs to be felt before moving on.
- There's this tradeoff between routine and living in the moment in the modern world. Living in the moment all the time unfortunately loads the closest meaningless deadline onto my attention and evolves into drifting down a river of external pressures. Routine all the time leads to a lack of imagining any other possibility, turning into drifting down a river of internal pressures. The difficult trick is intentionally working towards something, but shocking myself every so often with something completely unpredictable. Ex: Pilgrimage to Yukon...
- Sometimes in life, I've been working hard for years and years and I look up, look around me, and realise I'm not happy where I am, don't quite remember how I got here, and don't quite know where to go next. In these moments, it can feel like years of effort have been for nothing and I'm once again starting from scratch. But thinking on it a second time, if I'm not happy where I am, then what else would I do but start from scratch? It wouldn't make sense to just say: "Well, the momentum is still going this way so I might as well stay on the bandwagon." Realising this, starting from scratch doesn't sound like a scary disappointment. It sounds more like an exciting new effort.
- The hardest part about love is that it's given, not earned.
- I don't know how many times I've fallen down, but I know how many times I've gotten up. It's the number of times I've fallen down + 1.

### What I Did
- Wrapped up my design team's experiments creating a [chatbot to analyse political legislation](https://github.com/Madhav-Malhotra/political-chatbot).
- Learned about devops, deploying a software service on Azure from start to finish for the first time. The process was heinous to say the least. I would offer notes, but there's nothing conceptually valuable to note ;-; It's just day after day of searching through the corners of the Internet to analyse massive pages of docs, just to realise that companies as large as Microsoft can have incorrect documentation for tools that just don't do what they say they do. And then a bunch more trial and error to correct this x 15.
- Moved forward from/with heartbreak.
- Finished midterms at university. [Ongoing notes on electronic amplifiers](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1CuvtGQd1jCrdGZINXAh47Psb3-XRD95q)
