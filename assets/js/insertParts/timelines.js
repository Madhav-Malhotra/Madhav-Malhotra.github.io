Else, I won&#39;t make a difference like I intended. Ie. <strong>Doing good vs. feeling good</strong></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Made a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1trhjwNfIGaGR_E98G53S-F3m0X0M8_0g/view?usp=sharing\">recommendation</a> to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca\">Wealthsimple</a>, an online bank. It focused on how to get more low-income Canadians access to education grants by the government. </li> <li>Learning about problem-solving techniques. Adding what I learn to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/2049564273b6\">this</a> series of articles!</li> <li>Working on building my first website!</li> <li>Launching a fundraiser at my school called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://kahoot.com/\">Kahoot</a> for a Cause. Basically, raising money for human rights via trivia challenges!</li> <li>Guided a tour explaining the history of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/who-was-anne-frank/\">Anne Frank</a> and World War II :O</li> </ul>",
  1: "<h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Started learning the basics of making a website with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bulma.io/\">Bulma CSS</a></li> <li>Tried basic AI projects like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/dataseries/the-largest-hurdle-with-ai-9e25ca15b698\">recognising handwritten numbers</a></li> <li>Helped my school run a fundraiser to support mental health :-) This year, I didn&#39;t even forget to plug in the laptop which was running the speaker&#39;s slides! (That happened last year :O)</li> </ul>",
  2: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>The more time constraints, the more prioritisation needed. <ul> <li><strong>At the beginning of the day, write down the tasks that have urgent deadlines. Work on those before any others.</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li>Businesses need an economic incentive <em>first</em>. My team often struggled to filter ideas in hackathons due to this. We wanted to do the most good possible! But if we don&#39;t think about the bottom line, we won&#39;t do ANY good :/</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Created my first <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.madhavmalhotra.com/\">personal website</a>!</li> <li>Wrote a series of articles on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/the-vast-vast-world-of-problem-solving-2049564273b6\">problem-solving strategies</a></li> <li>Researching ideas for a hackathon on moonshot technologies: one in a million ideas that could potentially make a huge difference! Currently finalising an idea on tracking insect-borne ilnesses with AI</li> <li>Applying to lots of scholarships and internships :-)</li> </ul>",
  3: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Taking an easier path isn&#39;t good or bad. It often depends on your situation</strong>. <ul> <li>Ex: If learning AI, you could start with the basic math. Or you could just copy code from the Internet. Which is better? Well, if you want to make a career in AI, learning the fundamentals is important. But if you&#39;re actually curious about neuroscience and just want to see what kinds of applications AI has in neuroscience, it&#39;s better to actually focus on the part you&#39;re curious about.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>A closed door now is what makes you walk to the next open one.</strong><ul> <li>Ex: I didn&#39;t get hired for an internship I applied for. BUT that freed up my summer to work on an AI project with a team of people I love to be around :-)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Interviewed for an internship at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tdlab_/\">TD Labs</a>. I didn&#39;t get in, but I&#39;ve now given a job interview for the first time :D<ul> <li>One of my big lessons was to <strong>ask my interviewers personal questions at the end</strong>. It makes me more &#39;alive&#39; during a process that could use some &#39;aliveness&#39;. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Learned how to use Tensorflow to develop AI algorithms. Wrote about my experiences <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/rapid-progress-or-shallow-understanding-663bdedc80c1\">here</a></li> <li>Researched organic photovoltaics (solar panels). Made a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jqGbL7VWEmbQ3xGyFTsIZ9A4OGHdFpGg/view?usp=sharing\">summary</a> about this new type of solar panel!</li> <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNuZ9z9iZHM\">Pitched</a> a hackathon idea on how to use AI to predict the spread of insect-borne illnesses. </li> </ul>",
  4: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>The journey matters more than the destination.</strong> <ul> <li>It wasn&#39;t the final presentation, but every session along the way that defined my life-changing experience at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tks.world/\">TKS</a>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>It&#39;s exciting to look back on past success, but the most important part is using it to build upon the future. </li> <li>The biggest lesson from learning about new technologies like Artificial Intelligence is that <strong>an ordinary 16-year-old really can make an unthinkably large difference in our modern world.</strong> There&#39;s less and less getting in the way.</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Took part in the Microsoft Discover AI hackathon. Out of 125 teams in university, my ragtag highschool team made it in the top 25. Our idea was to use AI to track the spread of insect-borne diseases! <ul> <li>It&#39;s a nice lesson to just try :D Reflected about other lessons <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/can-you-really-change-the-world-at-16-7b7685309479\">here</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>Made an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/128HOsuSqrPV9QXt0mGNzH65EGp06m_BP/view\">infographic</a> on the applications of AI!</li> <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/2TKmqXiDvpE\">Spoke</a> at TKS about focusing on the journey over the destination. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tks.world/\">program</a> has literally changed the course of my life. I felt a lot of nostalgia wrapping up after a year.</li> </ul>",
  5: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>The closing of one door is how you look for another</strong><ul> <li>I&#39;ve been trying to keep this in mind given my family&#39;s soon to come move to another city. I can focus on the sadness of losing friends. Or I can focus on the new opportunities that lie ahead. </li> </ul> </li> <li>And problems in the end are good! They lead to massive changes! And massive changes fuel massive success.</li> <li>Every new discipline holds another perspective to understanding the world&#39;s complexity. And solving the world&#39;s problems. You really can connect everything to everything else. Ex: Fungi connect to human economies.</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Joined the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://slc.blog.ryerson.ca/sandbox/\">DMZ Sandbox</a> Accelerator to learn more about startups. </li> <li>Researched the energy industry, from nuclear fusion to advanced solar panels to better batteries. </li> <li>Finished taking intro to biology in summer school. It gives me a deeper appreciation for how the world works :-) Ex: What fungal mycelium networks can teach us about human societies.</li> <li>Planning logistics of moving to Toronto.</li> </ul>",
  6: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Everyone knows something I don&#39;t. It&#39;s my job to unlock it.</strong><ul> <li>So &#39;being bored&#39; in a conversation is really my fault.</li> <li>Ex: I met one financial employee randomly. I thought I&#39;d have nothing to talk to him about... 15 minutes later, he was telling me how his work in molecular genetics led him to a job in corporate finance! WHAT?!</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>My biggest gift is the people who care for me. They NEED to come first.</strong><ul> <li>This month, I&#39;ve been travelling hundreds of kilometres every day to attend an entrepreneurship accelerator. How? With my parent&#39;s financial support (and tolerating me waking up at 5 AM). And at the accelerator, I&#39;ve been having impromptu meetings left and right everyday. Understandably, my team was frustrated. So I wrote up a <em>very</em> long apology at 1 AM and a plan to fix this. The next morning, my team-mate forgave me and she told me to just get more sleep. <strong>The only reason I am where I am today is due to others&#39; support.</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Closed doors are GOOD. They keep you from going where you don&#39;t belong</strong><ul> <li>So in the end, you keep trying a new path to get to where you enjoy and fit!</li> <li>Ex: I interviewed a consultant who left a high-paying corporate job to start a startup. Why? Because he just wasn&#39;t in the right place yet. It&#39;s that simple.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Pitched at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://dmz.ryerson.ca/\">DMZ Startup Accelerator</a> for $5K to support a project using AI to detect emerging diseases. We came in top 5!<ul> <li>Travelled 2.5 hours 2x a day too many times to count this month :O When getting to the DMZ Accelerator</li> </ul> </li> <li>Wrote some articles about renewable energy from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/fd5474b69e7d\">nuclear fusion</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/2409910cab0a\">solar panels</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/a3c4830dc1b1\">batteries</a>. </li> <li>Interviewed 20 people in 5 days :O Lessons on what I learned <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bOykbosR3i3GGW2GyVmadv8GnES5Pc3VOmOXs8emg88/edit#gid=0\">here</a></li> </ul>",
  7: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>Hard work has delayed results. But it proves useful in unexpected ways later. <ul> <li>Ex: When I was at a techology festival, I found I had lots of cool stories to share with people! And they were about tiny projects I did over the summer, like just learning about basic concepts in AI. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>In a world changing faster than ever, generalists can adapt more quickly to new roles.</strong><ul> <li>Ex: This is why it makes sense to learn multiple unrelated skills to be better than 75% of people. Compared to learning one skill to be better than 95% of people. Mulitple unrelated skills are unlikely to all go out of use at the same time. </li> </ul> </li> <li>No new success comes without sacrificing something else. <strong>It&#39;s better to be aware of that sacrifice and prepare for it rather than be surprised by it.</strong><ul> <li>Ex: Though I had a great time at hackathons and technology festivals, I had no time for friends/family. And that created lots of negativity I wasn&#39;t ready for.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Was sponsored by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tks.world/\">TKS</a> to go to Elevate</strong>, Canada&#39;s largest technology festival.<ul> <li>It was a great experience! We got to see Michelle Obama roasting Donald Trump, hear Chris Hadfield sing Space Odyssey, and meet some Olympic athletes behind the scenes :D</li> </ul> </li> <li>Took part in TD Bank&#39;s hackathon to solve problems for the community. <strong>Designed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.figma.com/proto/OjFnhKwJDmbVRuq5kL74dk/Atro-Mobile-UI-kit---Figma-%5Bfreebie%5D-(Copy\">senior-accessible</a> mobile banking apps</strong> - which was weird to see a big bank lacking?</li> <li><strong>Researched the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x9j19x1Hurfr1HWnLBqTbyQvMrqTYCf1/view?usp=sharing\">banking industry&#39;s issues with regulations</a></strong>. Well, not any specific regulation. But how it costs $500M per year to TRACK changes in regulations. </li> <li>Wrote some articles on lessons learned from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/55902482cb8\">Plato</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/6240d0822429\">Socrates</a>. Also, a random article on the uses of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/a7f6c8e919b1\">haptic technology</a>. </li> <li>Moving from Waterloo to Toronto this month :O</li> </ul>",
  8: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>Stoicism tidbit: <strong>if it&#39;s in my control, don&#39;t worry about it. If it&#39;s out of my control, don&#39;t worry about it.</strong> For those keeping track - just don&#39;t worry about it :D</li> <li><strong>The best relationships start without a plan</strong><ul> <li>Ex: I didn&#39;t know whether I was accepted into a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qosf.org\">hackathon</a> until the day before. I wasn&#39;t sure about going, but I had an AMAZING time with friends! (And the Vietnamese subs were great too ;-)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Learned the basics of quantum computing at an incredibly fun <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qosf.org/\">hackathon</a>!<ul> <li>We ran an experiment on whether quantum computers or regular computers could detect flowers in images faster. My old laptop was 2600x faster than a quantum computer :D</li> </ul> </li> <li>Wrote about the commonalities between <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/@madhav.malhotra003/buddha-how-giving-up-everything-led-to-happiness-2018e4f863e9\">Buddhism</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/@madhav.malhotra003/how-an-ancient-philosopher-beat-google-to-finding-productivity-df31cd7f6eb5\">Daoism</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/@madhav.malhotra003/the-most-epic-philosopher-of-all-29e8c9a6c826\">Stoicism</a>.</li> <li>Researched the root cause of why <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IC1Vgw2WLMU1Nr7iG4NxtUJ-MbyO3IyC\">processing insurance claims</a> costs the industry $1.1B :O</li> <li>Made a video about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/Zqj_QfGvf6s\">future battery technologies</a> ;-)</li> <li>Helped decorate (dabbed paint in minor areas of) a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AFDHGWguzRx_4earV9weil4ZT-9AcqNk/view?usp=sharing\">pumpkin</a> that looks like Venom :D</li> <li>Sang the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/GBsuJHny3uo\">theme song from Moana in public</a> :O</li> </ul>",
  9: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>Life&#39;s problem&#39;s repeat themselves. So by tracking my problems, I&#39;ll have fewer nasty surprises :D <ul> <li>I learned this from Ray Dalio, who recommends <strong>tracking decisions you make to see their outcomes</strong>. That way, you can check for any common mistakes you make.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Learned about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PersonalityHackerPodcast\">personality types</a>! They let me better understand what I&#39;m strong at and weak at. <ul> <li>Ex: I use this to set goals to fix MY specific weaknesses. </li> <li>Ex: I use this to know where I&#39;m so bad I&#39;d better delegate X to others :D</li> </ul> </li> <li>Failure is a forcing function to fix what&#39;s wrong. So in a tough spot, I don&#39;t need to think: &quot;Phew... I&#39;m glad it&#39;s over.&quot; I could think: &quot;Wow... I&#39;m glad that happened!&quot;</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Pitched a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fasken.com/en/\">law-firm</a> on how to improve customer service with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.figma.com/proto/uX318JhjwrMju3giWDcNvg/PRIVATE-LEGAL-MOCKUP?node-id=483%3A55&amp;scaling=scale-down\">Salesforce</a>.</li> <li>Took part in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ethwaterloo.com/\">EthWaterloo</a> hackathon! I didn&#39;t learn too much due to some disappearing team members :/ But nice food at least :D</li> <li>Wrote some articles on lessons learned from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/why-the-loneliest-person-is-also-the-most-powerful-2c69a88e2c64\">Marcus Aurelius</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/@madhav.malhotra003/have-you-considered-the-depths-of-your-mind-ae9a4d6c1a42\">Carl Jung</a>.</li> <li>Updated my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.madhavmalhotra.com\">website</a> :-)</li> <li>Read <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://resources.madhavmalhotra.com/56d126378c1f4188a1795008820776d3?p=d49e6de239c8430e8798ed638a4e99e2\">Principles</a> by Ray Dalio! Interesting takes on decision-making. Could&#39;ve been a little more practical.</li> </ul>",
  10: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>Not every goal has a &#39;hack&#39;. Sometimes, it&#39;s as simple as more effort = more progress. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html\">Paul Graham</a> has useful thoughts on how to find areas that work like this.</li> <li><strong>Life doesn&#39;t owe me anything</strong><ul> <li>I applied to a standup comedy audition. Didn&#39;t get in. Felt bad because I thought of myself as a &#39;funny guy.&#39; Especially when a failure challenges my identity, I have to reduce my ego and realise I&#39;m not owed anything. And try to form less rigid identities in the future.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Watch <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://resources.madhavmalhotra.com/documentary-recommendations\">documentaries</a> about the developing world.</strong> I&#39;ll realise I have every reason in the world to be grateful.</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Made a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IVTrph6ewMaZKt12pnX_jbZ_DD5hodNZ/view\">recommendation</a> for Sidewalk Labs on how to increase access to affordable housing :-)</li> <li>Researched how <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/microgrids-how-to-prepare-energy-grids-for-the-next-superstorm-708582bdae6c\">microgrids</a> can increase energy reliability amidst growing natural disasters.<ul> <li>And <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/4-technologies-that-can-reshape-the-future-of-batteries-76db9ed7156e\">future types of batteries</a> that might be in a plane, train, or iPhone near you soon :D</li> </ul> </li> <li>Started learning Excel</li> <li>Did some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/L_kWtTwTiXo\">funny Star Wars skits</a> with a banana :D</li> <li>Survived another crazy busy exams season :O</li> </ul>",
  11: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Without effort, you can get things done. But you can&#39;t love getting them done</strong><ul> <li>Ex: The more energy I put <em>in</em> to meetings (being enthusiastic, preparing beforehand, etc.), the more I get <em>out</em> of them. Versus checking them off a todo list.</li> </ul> </li> <li>It&#39;s easy to accept what you&#39;ve never had. It&#39;s hard to give up what you previously had.<ul> <li>Ex: I&#39;ve been vegetarian my entire life. I don&#39;t &#39;miss&#39; meat - I don&#39;t even know what it tastes like :D But friends who&#39;re trying to go vegetarian for the first time - they have a lot more to give up :/</li> <li>Implication? <strong>Be careful about the comforts you let into your life</strong>. If you&#39;ve never had 6 gigabytes of cell phone data, takeout every day, a house with X bedrooms, ... you won&#39;t miss them. But if you get these things, it&#39;ll be harder to give them up. </li> </ul> </li> <li>We make mountains out of what we&#39;d rather not do. But <strong>the moment we get started, it gets easier</strong><ul> <li>Ex: Me writing a chemistry report is 6/10 boring, but me thinking about doing it is 9/10 boring :D</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Finished my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.madhavmalhotra.com/blog/2019-annual-reflection.html\">2019 annual reflection</a>. Summary: <strong>I grew more in 2019 than the rest of my life up to this point</strong>.</li> <li>Got through my last exams in highschool!</li> <li>Finished a course on Excel! I feel like getting any data and creating tables and charts out of it these days :D Made a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UbMjeJgTU2Su3d_XHWhyByKmqkWIZf19Jfe7M_fe2Wo/edit\">team tracker</a> to practice my skills ;-)</li> <li>Researched root causes of not having electricity access (because you don&#39;t have ID to sign up for loans to get electricity infrastructure). And for accidental deaths in hospitals (because staff don&#39;t have transfer protocols when changing who cares for a patient).<ul> <li>Also wrote an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/@madhav.malhotra003/how-to-speed-up-rural-electrification-67f03cf05bec\">article</a> on electricity access in rural areas!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Wrote about an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/@madhav.malhotra003/gratitude-the-most-surprising-superpower-6350caa49fee\">experiment</a> on finding as many things to be grateful for as possible!</li> </ul>",
  12: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>My decisions are always a bit random. So I should be less hard on myself</strong><ul> <li>No really! I can&#39;t control which next thought will come up. Ex: &quot;&quot;Think of a movie&quot;&quot; --&gt; I didn&#39;t have any control on the first movie that came to my head. Or the second, third, or fourth. So any decision I take is a little random + a little out of my control.</li> </ul> </li> <li>We can&#39;t change the world. We can change our interpretations.<ul> <li>And how we interpret an event determines how we feel! Ex: <strong>Interpreting a negative event as a challenge to grow from</strong> (fancy word: &#39;challenge appraisal&#39;) reduces negative emotions.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>All progress decays. Accept it and work with it</strong><ul> <li>Ex: I can get frustrated I don&#39;t remember how to code X. Or, I can take notes to look back on <em>accepting</em> that I&#39;ll forget what I learned soon.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Won a hackathon on how to use IoT sensors to detect leaks in oil pipelines. Boring issue, but important for the planet!</li> <li>Made a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpSE8jWGMCE&amp;feature=emb_title\">presentation</a> on how new financial models are the key to energy access in developing countries.</li> <li>Learning Javascript/HTML basics to better work with websites.</li> <li>Ran a ballet workshop on how to do pirouttes after 3 days of Youtube lessons :D</li> <li>Started a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y8EGiicKIOyKpSyWzClo_yiylSVzZIO8AJvsGwsBXW0/edit#slide=id.p1\">hackathon</a> on how to reduce insurance costs for youth, while keeping them safer.</li> </ul>",
  13: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Appreciate the easy and prepare for the hard</strong><ul> <li>While not being stressed is nice, the stressful times are when I&#39;ll NEED these lessons. It makes me calm to <strong>say it: &quot;&quot;These are the times I was preparing for :-)&quot;&quot;</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li>Each of us is our own biggest problem<ul> <li>When working on an intense <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xiTQzc7j4DBFHqJNSwxErREOMsnrrtAU/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=105097949967956622433&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true\">project</a> with a high-achieving team, I felt insecure. I worried whether I was good enough. But I was the only one worrying that! My team-mates didn&#39;t judge me. My biggest problem was in my head.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>A leader starts a message. A follower starts a movement.</strong><ul> <li>We all focus on the most charismatic leaders. But what&#39;s the point of leadership? To make successful movements? But the success of a movement is based on how many people <em>follow</em>.

In 3 weeks, <strong>spent 100+ hours making a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xiTQzc7j4DBFHqJNSwxErREOMsnrrtAU/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=105097949967956622433&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true\">recommendation</a> for an early education startup.</strong> They work to bring high-quality preschools to slums in Kenya.

  14: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>I have natural tendencies, not strengths vs. weaknesses</strong><ul> <li>Ie. I just act one way. Sometimes, that&#39;s useful. Sometimes, it&#39;s not. Ex: I like being helpful. That&#39;s good around close friends. But bad around exploitative team-mates.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>I need SOME boredom in life.</strong> Boring times are when my brain can &#39;explore&#39; and find new lessons (like these ;-). Instead of worrying about <em>__</em>.</li> <li><strong>Failure is when we finally stop the car to fix the warning light</strong><ul> <li>Ie. It FORCES us to stop. Instead of knowing that we have X bad habit, Y insecurity, Z neglected commitment, ... but not doing anything about those warning lights.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Started researching the root causes of plastic pollution.</strong> More research to come <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.madhavmalhotra.com/ThePlasticShift\">here</a> as we dive deeper!</li> <li>Made some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.figma.com/proto/dXxgcwdfuKgXKsG6KgD3zA/TDInsurance-Hackathon-2020?node-id=1%3A121&amp;scaling=scale-down-width\">app mockups</a> for a hackathon. The goal is to reduce crashes for young drivers :O</li> <li>Made a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://resources.madhavmalhotra.com/ted-talk-recommendations\">playlist of the most insightful TED talks</a> I&#39;ve found ;-)</li> <li>Found a lot of inspiration from Jordan Peterson&#39;s lectures on having personal responsibility! Wrote a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.madhavmalhotra.com/blog/captives-to-our-feeds.html\">reflection</a> on what I learned :-)</li> <li>Researched the effect of COVID-19 on markets/industries. After studying the impacts of the 2008 financial crisis on different income-levels, I wonder how similar/different this crisis will be?</li> </ul>",
  15: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Someone else getting more doesn&#39;t mean I get less.</strong><ul> <li>In the modern world, there are LITERALLY countless problems to solve, careers to have, awards to win, etc. It&#39;s very rare to have people on the exact same path. Ie. If a &#39;competitor&#39; wins, that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have a chance to win.</li> </ul> </li> <li>When things go wrong, we turn to leaders.<ul> <li>I know a CEO whose company hosted an online conference. It cost $50,000. Last minute, there was a technical issue. All the staff were panicking! And everyone started messaging the CEO. From the outside, it was interesting to observe how people IMMEDIATELY turn to leaders under stress.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Our brains haven&#39;t somehow become more rational in modern times</strong><ul> <li>We might do more abstract thinking. But we still have the same biases as ever! Ex: we still have the same <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_cave_the_4_stories_we_tell_ourselves_about_death\">myths about death</a> now as cavemen did.</li> <li>Realising this with humility is the first step towards making better decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Started <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://madhavmalhotra.com/ThePlasticShift\">The Plastic Shift</a> with my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ayleen-farnood-747b9614b\">team-mate</a>. We&#39;ve <strong>created resources explaining root causes and potential solutions in plastic pollution.</strong></li> <li>Started a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKi8i0zkVlmjex0cdrMRiUQ\">podcast</a> to <strong>interview experts in plastic pollution!</strong></li> <li>Failed at pitching a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16NxaJkT85DWapV4_35GPtSZengYfqSNe/view?usp=sharing\">mobile app</a> to reduce distracted driving.

But what&#39;s propreitary, which employees are needed, and how much time/cost to expect.</li> <li>Got <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2oHW7xH-3A\">feedback</a> from a child education startup in Kenya that my team consulted for :-)</li> </ul>",
  16: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Positivity isn&#39;t about how I appear to others</strong><ul> <li>I had a lot of meetings with people where I forced myself to be enthusiastic. But this left me tired. To actually feel more &#39;positive&#39;, I had to remember I was lucky to still meet people. Ie. <strong>Real positivity comes from basic, pleasant emotions like gratitude, faith, hope, etc.</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>I judge myself more than anyone ever will</strong><ul> <li>Ex: This month, I missed a meeting with a mentor. She wasn&#39;t mad. But I never forgot that moment, even years later. This is something I need to get over if I want to grow from mistakes instead of wallowing in them.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>I have problems running amok in my head. And that makes me lucky.</strong><ul> <li>Some have to worry about finding enough food, shelter, water, medication, etc. to live. But I only have to worry about writing forty pages of essays. I&#39;m lucky I only have to deal with problems in my head :-)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Spoke at a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDswb_1l2XU\">webinar</a> on plastic pollution by The Ellen MacArthur Foundation!</li> <li>Created some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhavmalhotra.com/ThePlasticShift/infographics.html\">infographics</a> explaining the basics of plastic pollution.<ul> <li>And helped Plastic Bank create some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/175_BUpmZedTG3Temz9pzgWsK1AvG3c-D_OMhhwkTs6k/edit?usp=sharing\">presentations</a> explaining the problem to youth.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Recorded <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/4wjMEfWrc3c\">podcasts</a> with chemists, marine biologists, and waste management experts from Norway to Mexico. </li> <li>Won a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.agorize.com/en/challenges/td-insurance-2020\">TD Insurance hackathon</a> with an idea on how to keep youth drivers safer, while also reducing costs! It was very unexpected, since we snuck in as the only highschool team amidst 150 university teams :D</li> <li>Wrote a few blog posts on lessons we can learn from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.madhavmalhotra.com/survivors-of-the-rubble.html\">Syrian refugees</a>, why it&#39;s hard to understand the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhavmalhotra.com/cycle-of-failure.html\">value of failure</a> when young, and how to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhavmalhotra.com/hang-glider-theory.html\">keep our options open</a> in life.</li> </ul>",
  17: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Career is not equal to identity</strong><ul> <li>When I ask people who they are, they tell me what they do. But people are more than what they do. Not realising this prevents us from finding <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/career-identity-e9ed825d82a6\">close relationships</a>.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Life works on its own schedule. Do my work, then step back.</strong><ul> <li>I can easily stress about when scholarship decisions come out, when mentors will email back, when team-mates will finish their part... But I can&#39;t control any of that. Do my work, then move on. They work on their own schedule.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>Started a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRBGFeAh48DcVIFQ11OFw1g\">podcast</a> with my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ayleen-farnood-747b9614b\">team-mate</a> to interview specialised researchers!<ul> <li>I was interviewing experts in plastic pollution and realised how there were so many niche areas of knowledge I&#39;d never heard of. That was a shame... so I decided to fix it!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Made a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://creativity-trainer.web.app/random-objects\">creativity game</a> with React! Much more fun than note-taking app tutorials :D</li> <li>Finished creating a course on plastic pollution with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://plasticbank.com/\">Plastic Bank</a>!<ul> <li>Also, made a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O07CMjZl5Ygp8tcq0l_V_5xk5GWwLnavR-5qjSbwX8Q/edit?usp=sharing\">recommendation</a> on how to make more impact for Plastic Oceans Canada :-)</li> </ul> </li> </ul>",
  18: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>What I work on &gt; how hard I work</strong> - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/naval/status/738857029108797440?lang=en\">Naval Ravikant</a><ul> <li>Growing up, I often prided my work ethic. But as I work on more projects, I&#39;ve realised that I CAN work hard on the wrong things. Ex: Imagine Elon Musk used his determination to be a great accountant :D</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>It&#39;s the people that say yes to opportunities.</strong> <ul> <li>The most influential work ALWAYS involves multiple people. Learning to work together is thus inevitable. No matter how nerve-wracking it can sometimes be for an introvert :D</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>If it&#39;s not fun, I won&#39;t do it</strong>. <ul> <li>Ex: I researched <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhavmalhotra.com/ThePlasticShift\">plastic pollution</a> for 6 months, mainly because I enjoyed being around <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayleen-farnood-747b9614b\">my team-mate</a> :D</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Finished learning React.

  19: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Sometimes, a step back is better than a step forward</strong><ul> <li>Ex: When I had to stop <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://madhavmalhotra.com/ThePlasticShift\">researching plastic pollution</a> after 4 months of no clear next steps.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>There are many correct ways to see reality. I have to choose the most useful.</strong><ul> <li>Ex: In physics, you can solve problems with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system\">polar coordinates</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system\">cartesian coordinates</a>. For circular motion, polar coordinates are more convenient!</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>I can&#39;t be successful when I haven&#39;t defined success.</strong><ul> <li>This isn&#39;t some academic wordplay. I mean it practically! Writing down the person I&#39;m aiming to become in whatever time period is SO useful. Whenever I feel demotivated, I come back to that. And it&#39;s an easy way to find out what to do next.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Interviewing several sustainable startups</strong> about the biggest problems they face. Wrote some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/music-and-microbiology-a-case-study-from-nyoka-labs-2c8e80f98f37\">case studies</a> on what I learned!</li> <li><strong>Interviewed 13 researchers</strong> on my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRBGFeAh48DcVIFQ11OFw1g\">podcast</a>.

  20: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>People make the world go around.</strong> And not just from their work.<ul> <li>Ex: Who keeps me <em>happy enough</em> to work <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness\">all my life</a>?</li> <li>Ex: Who are the people who said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/aCuXgyI5wh0?t=1457\">one sentence</a> that completely changed my perspective on the world?</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>The universe doesn&#39;t owe me anything</strong><ul> <li>Many of our problems with the &#39;world&#39; are really problems with &#39;our expectations of the world&#39;. If we change our expectations, we can take away a lot of our problems.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Happiness comes BEFORE success</strong> - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11c3ueBnU-r59OJeu-j6e3t2c9onKT1Jep5qkGc6HpLE/edit\">Sadhguru</a>.

Biggest lesson? <strong>People like stories a lot more than advice :D</strong></li> <li>Learned some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/69fKNJuhdAY\">negotiation basics</a>. Ex: Focusing on &#39;interests&#39; &gt; &#39;positions&#39; (why they want X vs. what they want). </li> <li><strong>Failed at winning a scholarship</strong>.

  21: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>We can&#39;t turn back time.</strong> <ul> <li>I know this, but don&#39;t act like it. Ex: When I daydream about being a child again. Ex: When I wish a relationship were different like before.</li> <li>The solution? To learn to adapt to/accept the present. Like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/zzzAURCTPfc?t=159\">water</a></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>No one can get you what you want... when you don&#39;t know what you want.</strong><ul> <li>Ex: No number of college application hacks will help me feel less worried about where I&#39;m going in life. But sitting down to decide what I want - that will.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Ask more questions</strong>. A 3-year-old asks hundreds of questions a day. Adults get trained out of it. But asking <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.beiE4jASYcopo\">stupid, basic, childish questions</a> is a habit of incredibly successful adults!</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Finished university applications</strong></li> <li><strong>Interviewed several entrepreneurs</strong> about challenges for running small businesses sustainably.</li> <li>Wrote an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/when-did-you-last-think-for-yourself-993c035e9cdf\">article</a> about sitting on my bed... just to prove I could turn any boring topic into an interesting story :D<ul> <li>Highly recommend this <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-addictive-articles\">article-writing guide</a>!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Also, wrote a few <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/perception-reality-now-what-23cb87336e4d\">reflections</a> I only realise now at the end of highschool.</li> <li>I <strong>recorded 5 podcasts with researchers</strong> on topics like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/qExPMW5_9zk\">geoengineering</a> and philosophical insights in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/ZbHdKbMIglw\">evolution</a>!</li> </ul>",
  22: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>So many of our thoughts are just planning for the future and reminiscing about the past. </li> <li><strong>These days right NOW... these are the good old days I’ll look back on.</strong><ul> <li>It&#39;s all a unique mix of experiences in time that I&#39;ll never get back</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>If I find I&#39;m always right, I&#39;m not making hard enough decisions.</strong></li> <li><strong>Employees see their work as a task.

  23: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>If I don’t care about myself, I won’t grow. I won’t even want to live. <ul> <li><strong>Self-esteem is the prerequisite to ANY success.</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Schedule time to do nothing</strong>. Just stop and think.<ul> <li>I’ll find new perspectives on old problems.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Don’t make decisions while feeling negative</strong>. Wait a day. </li> <li>Don’t be a victim. Self-pity makes me unhappy. It doesn’t solve problems. <ul> <li>Instead of whining, ask: <strong>&quot;&quot;What’s the first step to fixing this?”</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li>If I feel upset, say: <strong>“This too shall pass.” Nothing matters as much as I think in the long run</strong></li> <li><strong>Placebos are practical</strong>. If it feels good, it works!<ul> <li>Point at myself and laugh for no reason.</li> <li>Imagine <strong>an alien is in front of me. It has the EXACT same problems as me. What advice would I give it?</strong></li> <li>Make a deal with landmarks like trees: “I bet so many humans that pass you aren’t smiling. So I’ll make you a deal, tree. I’ll start smiling and you can have better sights to see! Win win!”</li> </ul> </li> <li>I don’t need to be in control to feel calm. <strong>If I accept what’s out of my control, I’ll also feel calm</strong>.<ul> <li>Ex: Relationship issues: “They’re going to [verb] and it’s out of my control. Oh well.”</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Prototyping a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sustainable-can-be-profitable.web.app/\">forum</a> where customers can share the sustainable product ideas they&#39;re looking for with businesses.</li> <li>Interviewed a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/z4BfMLqM6Q0?t=533\">soil ecologist</a> on how worms are LITERALLY reshaping the world.</li> <li>Built a collection of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://resources.madhavmalhotra.com/documentary-recommendations\">eye-opening documentaries</a> to get perspective on the world.</li> <li>Nearly done with high school!

  24: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>When struggling, <strong>be the supporter I wish I&#39;d had.</strong> Plan what&#39;d make me happy.

Tell others my intention is to help. </li> <li><strong>Let them talk as much as possible</strong>. Ask open-ended questions. Leave silence to think. Ask for examples.

  25: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Action needs intention</strong>.

Ex: <strong>Set a timer and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app\">don&#39;t stop writing</a>.</strong></li> <li>Venting emotions to others is a healthy habit.</li> <li>To get to 10x better, ask: <strong>“What can X do that can’t be done anywhere else?”</strong></li> <li>To listen well, I have to WANT to listen. I&#39;ll want to listen if I&#39;m asking questions that lead to interesting answers. Ask:<ul> <li><strong>“What’s the most surprising thing you learned about this week?”</strong></li> <li><strong>“What’s something [adjective] you do that most others don’t?”</strong></li> <li><strong>“What’s a big challenge you’ve faced that shapes who you are today?”</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li>Immediately after negativity, reflect: <strong>“How can I grow from this?”</strong></li> <li><strong>When thanking, complimenting, encouraging, etc. - add SPECIFIC details</strong>.</li> <li>Keep giving till I learn to stop expecting something in return. Ex: <strong>Thank someone every day</strong>.</li> <li>Usually, I fear what others think. Not failure. <ul> <li><strong>To overcome the fear of what others think, do tiny things to look ridiculous</strong>. Ex: Wear a tie with a sports shirt.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Self-confidence is based on intention, not results. <ul> <li><strong>Before starting a task, do a positive affirmation about my intention</strong>. Ex: “I will pursue this out of curiosity and will persist even if there are setbacks.”</li> </ul> </li> <li>Avoid preprepared questions in meetings. <strong>Ask followups whenever possible.</strong></li> <li><strong>Ask: “WHY am I feeling [negative emotion]?” Curiosity dissipates negativity.</strong></li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Started teaching a course on AI starting with grade 8 math</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqgr5FD_y_wLYetqEkzc68eReW2gHK14Q\">here</a></li> <li>Volunteering at a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://terraoptima.ca/\">startup</a> to make <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rRZ7ocCgJ5Z8mmdlc8DyFeFb4hUxDWtM/view?usp=sharing\">3D models</a> of composting systems</li> <li>Training to be a speaker at a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jack.org/\">mental health nonprofit</a></li> <li>4 speaking challenges: a history presentation, two skits, and reading children&#39;s books <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0PsdWnY7Ec&amp;list=PLqgr5FD_y_wLuR5DMQCRNQN0UYNab983G&amp;index=5\">here</a></li> <li>Researched 4 speakers: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://quizlet.com/ca/649001197/\">Oprah Winfrey</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://quizlet.com/ca/645654600/\">Cal Fussman</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://quizlet.com/ca/643587057/\">Ben Shapiro</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://quizlet.com/ca/641175196/\">Christopher Hitchens</a>.</li> <li>Made <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://resources.madhavmalhotra.com/health-notes\">notes</a> on how to fix dozens of health and mental health issues.</strong></li> <li>Researched childhood trauma in 27 influential historical figures. <strong>Wrote an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/all-greatness-comes-from-suffering-3a39d85ca77d\">article</a> on how &#39;heros&#39; are as vulnerable as all of us.</strong></li> </ul>",

Ex: Ask a new friend for their address to send a christmas gift first.</li> <li><strong>Curiosity dissipates conflict</strong>. When mad, ask: &quot;Why am I mad?&quot;</li> <li><strong>At the start of the day, make a todo list. Write WHY I&#39;m doing each todo. Write which part of each task holds most value. Do that first.

  37: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>ITERATE on all these actions.</strong> It often takes me 3+ tries to learn how to do each one well.</li> <li>Stop to think: <strong>&quot;What&#39;s life like for them right now?&quot;</strong> Try asking them for time to think during a call. Or do it right after a call. Empathy is slow.</li> <li>Shared struggle = connection. But not great for giving advice (due to shared blindspot).<ul> <li>So <strong>let others know when I relate to their struggles.</strong> Adds trust.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Explicitly state your intentions when trying to help.</strong> Reduces misunderstandings.<ul> <li>Ex: Add to the end of any advice: &quot;I hope this helps you [do sthng]&quot; </li> </ul> </li> <li>What do I think I understand well? That&#39;s what I MOST need to double-check.<ul> <li>Ex: I thought I understood someone like a &#39;soul-sister&#39;. Tried writing down what I thought I knew about her. But I just wrote what I knew about myself. I was just ASSUMING that also applied to her. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>At the end of any project, ask: &quot;How might I be wrong?&quot;</strong><ul> <li>Often, this happens because I haven&#39;t seen some new perspective. Ex: ANY time I research a global problem (ex: mental health), experts tell me things I never found in any report.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Tough decision? Stop thinking of facts about <em>the options</em>. Instead, think about <em>my priorities.</em><ul> <li>Fixes &#39;analysis paralysis&#39;. Especially if I have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://resources.madhavmalhotra.com/24898a3166654a56bbcab5395255d643?p=88464b0d4cf7483786a4bee86c119e12\">just a few values</a> to compare.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Before meeting X, think of positive things they&#39;ve done for me.</strong> Makes me more enthusiastic.</li> <li>Too busy?

But that unintentional wandering didn&#39;t help. When I made a list of exactly which actions to take (e.g. code an AI model that detects scam websites) - then, I had clear progress. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>What I do &gt; who I do it with &gt; how I do it</strong><ul> <li>Ex: Found myself getting high grades in physics after lots of studying. But &#39;success&#39; had no consequence because the goal didn&#39;t matter. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Jump into the deep end. Give myself an opportunity to learn.</strong><ul> <li>Ex: I didn&#39;t know anything about microcontrollers. I could assume I&#39;m incompetent and look for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_XkGju35MI\">most basic</a> resources I can find. Or, I could read more about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers/all#extra-credit-proof\">physics</a> and challenge myself.

It seems that I\'m in a great position to fail soft (as I\'m privileged enough to live in a highly-developed country), but I\'m not yet in a great position to win hard.</li><li>Paraphrasing: \'Real freedom is about attention.

Ie. Intentionally, personally decided that their education mattered to them. At the end of a life, my education is my path to living a more fulfilling life. It\'s the masterpiece of a lifetime of effort.

Worrying about the entire, huge problem doesn\'t help anyone, though. If I start with the smallest action (ex: reading a single research paper), I can build that on to a larger next step.

Anything I\'m scared of, uncertain about, not ready for, etc. - it\'ll still be waiting for me later unless I start working to change now. </li><li>Underrated habit: do the hardest thing first.

  52: "<h3>What I Learned</h3><ul><li>Environments HUGELY change how easy it is to meet people. Ex: Difficult environment to meet people: cluttered room where I have to walk up to groups of people to start conversations. Ex: Easy environment to meet people: small circular tables where people are waiting to start a board game. </li><li>In the short run, anything but stuck is fine. Anything but stuck gets me new experiences.

  53: "<h3>What I Learned</h3><ul><li>Organising events = a lot of upfront annoyances. But also a lot of followup serendipity (social connections / referrals specifically). </li><li><strong>Waking up early = extra wiggle room to deal with the day\'s problems.</strong> Wise move in a world where things breaking is the norm. <ul><li>Similarly, starting tasks early = more time to gauge difficulty and reallocate time/resources. <strong>Try problems early for a good 15-30 mins. THEN, decide when/how much to work on them.</strong></li></ul></li><li>I don\'t like having my back against the wall.

It\'s that motivation to feel the universe so big and undiscovered that drives human exploration.</li><li>Poor vacation goal: cover all the [blank] spots. Creates hectic, hollow experiences. Better vacation goal: discover the one place where I can sit and appreciate for hours.<ul><li> Read: no optimising how to get from A to B. \'Taste-test\' in one place and hope to discover enough marvel to drop B. </li> <li> Read: <strong>it\'s about HOW I look, not what I look at</strong>.

When humanity\'s knowledge has become so concentrated, it\'s not useful to visit experts just to get answers to questions. Poor response: stop visiting experts. Better response: use the freed-up time to invest more in building relationships.</li></ul><h3>What I Did</h3><ul><li>Wrapped up university exams and started <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://resources.madhavmalhotra.com/\">publishing what I learned</a>. Read: overload of math equations and circuits coming :D</li><li>Took a 5000 km road trip across maritime Canada. Discovered heaven in Canada (also known as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/160ePqs6UjSvNOqWf1cAFnso_fLE8y1aO/view?usp=sharing\">Chéticamp, Cape Breton</a>).</li></ul>",
  55: "<h3>What I Learned</h3><ul><li>It\'s not the message that matters, it\'s the journey of listening. <strong>It\'s not the knowledge that matters, it\'s the journey of understanding.</strong> That\'s each individual\'s path to meaning and revelation in their lives.<ul><li>Many adults have preached to me the greatness of India. I found all their speeches obnoxious. Yet when I saw <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoq8B8ThgEM\">this music video</a> celebrating the common perception of love across religious and cultural lines, I came to newly appreciate the diversity and cultural depth in India\'s history. It was <em>my</em> process of understanding and finding meaning/beauty in what makes the world valuable.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Best way to ask for feedback: consistently and ahead of time</strong>. Asking in-the-moment or one-off, people hesitate to be fully honest over polite. </li><li>Just a personal reflection, but my most  when I have power is to see how I can create opportunities that benefit others. Whereas some take on positions of leadership with an intuition of using the resources available to them to progress towards their goals. The benefits of the latter are making more directed progress towards a focused vision. The benefits of the former are having a trusting team. Ideally, both kinds of leaders are helping an organisation. </li></ul><h3>What I Did</h3><ul><li><strong>Started a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wataicyber.substack.com/\">student design team</a> creating AI applications for cybersecurity</strong>. We onboarded 15 new members this month, set up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madhavmalhotra/unb-cic-iot-dataset\">our dataset</a>, and started publishing the papers we\'re reading! </li><li><strong>Created a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KHmoNx3zpCAaiHxTW/existential-cybersecurity-risks-and-ai-a-research-agenda\">research agenda on existential cybersecurity risks</a></strong>. Decided to dig deeper on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16X32c_VKGwS23sPJsDJdMcx12IkSyZbTAkX8Ehswmd0/edit?usp=sharing\">insider threats</a> at AI regulatory agencies, satellite constellation owners, frontier AI labs, and advanced semiconductor chip manufacturers.</li><li>Side learnings: Finished the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JJgH9NHg9IQhdXYhqM2z40hAID1kGbTvHK-pqb2nylE/edit\">Intro to Penetration Testing</a> at Hack The Box (buggy, but fun!). Started learning <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tf_B-6JyIB06GFwyWiLqgA1hEvMrqFj32Mnu3ePLIKw/edit\">math for cryptography</a>. Also randomly going through a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j18FXUEu3_vpDQ8xOc3Y0wT54jz2S54avX9Gu5UjZi4/edit\">fun course on contract law</a> :D  </li></ul>",
  56: "<h3>What I Learned</h3><ul><li>One of our human problems is <strong>we seek certainty over progress.</strong><ul><li>Ex: Countries want happier people, but GDP is easier to measure so they maximise GDP. For a long time this works, but eventually a country gets a whole lot of GDP and not a whole lot of happiness. </li><li>Ex: We want happier relationships, so we set up times to meet. Things are veritably getting done; we can see them on our calendar. But week after month after year, we\'re still longing for that spontaneous joy, play, and connection that defined our childhoods.</li></ul></li><li>In my experience, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.zenpencils.com/comic/80-henry-david-thoreau-on-happiness/\">chasing happiness and love seems to be like chasing butterflies</a>. The chasing doesn\'t work, but when I have moments of going about life without a care, the butterflies seem to show up.<ul><li>Ex: It\'s been hard for me to maintain connections with old friends. I felt I was forcing myself to keep investing and showing care when they didn\'t care anymore. Then, I tried stopping and trying to meet new friends by just showing up to random university clubs. <strong>It wasn\'t perfect, but it was progress :-)</strong></li></ul></li><li>My experience with travel has been that very little of it is the part where you get to the destination :D So <strong>why optimise the destination instead of the journey?</strong><ul><li>I mean this literally. How much time did I spend deciding which city to visit in Nova Scotia and how little did I spend deciding which games, music, podcasts, etc. might make the road trip to those cities more enjoyable? </li><li>I also mean it figuratively. How much time did I spend comparing university majors to decide which one to do? How much time did I spend thinking about how to best spend my time at the university while I\'m here? </li></ul></li></ul><h3>What I Did</h3><ul><li>Started a club called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://effectivepolitics.ca/\">Effective Politics</a>. Met a dozen professors to find mentors and started prepping marketing/events for January.</li><li>Continuing on a design team creating <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wataicyber.substack.com/\">AI applications for cybersecurity</a>. Experimented with bio-inspired algorithms like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wataicyber.substack.com/p/the-grey-wolf-optimiser\">grey-wolf optimiser</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wataicyber.substack.com/p/fun-graphs-with-genetic-algorithms\">genetic algorithm</a>. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/HoXCqWxnS-U\">Gave a talk</a> explaining these.</li><li>Personally learning about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j18FXUEu3_vpDQ8xOc3Y0wT54jz2S54avX9Gu5UjZi4/edit?usp=drive_web&amp;ouid=105097949967956622433\">contract law</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r2xG3n--gsxCPKh11HwOl_mm3v86wduYmS1-5edHla8/edit\">meteorology</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/C5X3XbHQkj5d8EeXg/fixing-insider-threats-in-the-ai-supply-chain\">preventing insider threats</a>, listening in debates, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SFJe-DggaX-f52H3F4A6KyY5RZFqgEa67vlNpwr2FUc/edit\">genetic programming</a>.</li></ul>",
  57: "<h3>What I Learned</h3><ul><li>Continued working on AI applications for cybersecurity at a student design team.

Also, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wataicyber.substack.com/p/from-gpus-to-raspberry-pi\">ran our first real test on a Raspberry Pi</a>! Gave an interview about our work, coming next month!</li><li>Started a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://effectivepolitics.substack.com/\">blog for my policy research club</a>. Finalising recruitment plans for the coming semester.</li><li>Finished a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FDC2IihsY0IgmQ9eTwS0Li6gR-UxEyoRot87TkSMpng/edit\">course on SQL</a>, course on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SFJe-DggaX-f52H3F4A6KyY5RZFqgEa67vlNpwr2FUc/edit\">bio-inspired AI</a> and a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ortBP65gVqYgtVd5cQbc6yh3h-TvSKoIs1SUXgNB38/edit#heading=h.ac2jkcyex6vj\">course on Git</a>.

You can show up to try to make a positive influence. But it\'s up to others to determine what sticks. That\'s the part that feels like an incredible honour :-)<ul><li>I first noted this when talking to a retiring department chair thinking about how he influenced his colleagues. At a smaller scale, I saw it when my team-mates were being interviewed about working at our design team. Very heart-warming to see them adopting my work-consistently, work-publicly philosophy!</li></ul></li></ul>",
  58: "<h3>What I Learned</h3><ul><li><strong>Information isn\'t very useful unless connected</strong>. This is true in CS data structures and it\'s true in education. A good habit to connect what I learn is to go from consuming knowledge to categorising knowledge. Ex: Stop to ask myself: \"WHY does X work this way? What past experiences could this have helped with?\"--&gt; This is one of the problems with courses instead of projects. If I\'m watching a Youtube tutorial, I don\'t know or have to know what\'s coming next. I just sit there and information comes my way. Though if I\'m creating a project, I have to work backwards from the end goal and fix every hitch along the way. Forces me to connect dots MUCH more.</li><li>Under-rated habits: <strong>never argue online. Wait 2-24 hours before sending negative messages online.</strong></li><li>Planning backwards is good at countering analysis paralysis. <strong>Even with uncertain outcomes, I have a certain plan to follow</strong>.--&gt; Another way to snap out of analysis paralysis is to think 4 months at a time only. </li><li><strong>Think like a lawyer: ex ante vs ex post.</strong> Ex ante thinking is pre-emptive, unbiased, not in reaction to something going wrong. Ex post thinking is reactive, with our judgement altered after something goes wrong. --&gt; Ex: If a friend disappoints me, I might feel bitter and want to start an argument. That might feel right ex post. But I should also stop to think ex ante. How can I reduce the chance of future events like this? Which incentives do I want to create for myself and for my friends?</li></ul><h3>What I Did</h3><ul><li>Finished up the first term of work at my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wataicyber.substack.com/\">student design team on AI and cybersecurity</a>.

We\'ll soon share some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/effectivepolitics/\">talks we\'re organising to learn from policymakers</a> who\'ve worked as MPPs, at the UN, and as researchers!</li><li>Finished a course on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h9NOb1-VsZOG2LYsK_S34TtIkigYcMYLP_O6Yp4S1K4/edit\">Kubernetes</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z7UPcBaG6xlJxylsoIikKqk3Y_vAJbyzyqUeSLb4HAg/edit\">data structures</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11UuWH8WMsIVQh9yJQzduHmsVYQUeJLtbGnoMn_L73ic/edit\">GDB</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OiRmshL__CoEHqlUWxlRlOrmNDPuKv4g6ZzvoYB0Ci4/edit\">Pyspark</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HHDOCSLnzRfgfVFGCkzYwu9yj5Z_DPTX7fWwOHOl9oI/edit#heading=h.fsj46pofwsb\">large language models</a>.
