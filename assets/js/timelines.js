  2: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>The more time constraints, the more prioritisation needed. <ul> <li><strong>At the beginning of the day, write down the tasks that have urgent deadlines. Work on those before any others.</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li>Businesses need an economic incentive <em>first</em>. My team often struggled to filter ideas in hackathons due to this. We wanted to do the most good possible! But if we don&#39;t think about the bottom line, we won&#39;t do ANY good :/</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Created my first <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.madhavmalhotra.com/\">personal website</a>!</li> <li>Wrote a series of articles on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/the-vast-vast-world-of-problem-solving-2049564273b6\">problem-solving strategies</a></li> <li>Researching ideas for a hackathon on moonshot technologies: one in a million ideas that could potentially make a huge difference! Currently finalising an idea on tracking insect-borne ilnesses with AI</li> <li>Applying to lots of scholarships and internships :-)</li> </ul>",
  3: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Taking an easier path isn&#39;t good or bad. It often depends on your situation</strong>. <ul> <li>Ex: If learning AI, you could start with the basic math. Or you could just copy code from the Internet. Which is better? Well, if you want to make a career in AI, learning the fundamentals is important. But if you&#39;re actually curious about neuroscience and just want to see what kinds of applications AI has in neuroscience, it&#39;s better to actually focus on the part you&#39;re curious about.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>A closed door now is what makes you walk to the next open one.</strong><ul> <li>Ex: I didn&#39;t get hired for an internship I applied for. BUT that freed up my summer to work on an AI project with a team of people I love to be around :-)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Interviewed for an internship at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tdlab_/\">TD Labs</a>. I didn&#39;t get in, but I&#39;ve now given a job interview for the first time :D<ul> <li>One of my big lessons was to <strong>ask my interviewers personal questions at the end</strong>. It makes me more &#39;alive&#39; during a process that could use some &#39;aliveness&#39;. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Learned how to use Tensorflow to develop AI algorithms. Wrote about my experiences <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/rapid-progress-or-shallow-understanding-663bdedc80c1\">here</a></li> <li>Researched organic photovoltaics (solar panels). Made a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jqGbL7VWEmbQ3xGyFTsIZ9A4OGHdFpGg/view?usp=sharing\">summary</a> about this new type of solar panel!</li> <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNuZ9z9iZHM\">Pitched</a> a hackathon idea on how to use AI to predict the spread of insect-borne illnesses. </li> </ul>",
  4: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>The journey matters more than the destination.</strong> <ul> <li>It wasn&#39;t the final presentation, but every session along the way that defined my life-changing experience at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tks.world/\">TKS</a>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>It&#39;s exciting to look back on past success, but the most important part is using it to build upon the future. </li> <li>The biggest lesson from learning about new technologies like Artificial Intelligence is that <strong>an ordinary 16-year-old really can make an unthinkably large difference in our modern world.</strong> There&#39;s less and less getting in the way.</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Took part in the Microsoft Discover AI hackathon. Out of 125 teams in university, my ragtag highschool team made it in the top 25. Our idea was to use AI to track the spread of insect-borne diseases! <ul> <li>It&#39;s a nice lesson to just try :D Reflected about other lessons <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/can-you-really-change-the-world-at-16-7b7685309479\">here</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>Made an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/128HOsuSqrPV9QXt0mGNzH65EGp06m_BP/view\">infographic</a> on the applications of AI!</li> <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/2TKmqXiDvpE\">Spoke</a> at TKS about focusing on the journey over the destination. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tks.world/\">program</a> has literally changed the course of my life. I felt a lot of nostalgia wrapping up after a year.</li> </ul>",
  5: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>The closing of one door is how you look for another</strong><ul> <li>I&#39;ve been trying to keep this in mind given my family&#39;s soon to come move to another city. I can focus on the sadness of losing friends. Or I can focus on the new opportunities that lie ahead. </li> </ul> </li> <li>And problems in the end are good! They lead to massive changes! And massive changes fuel massive success.</li> <li>Every new discipline holds another perspective to understanding the world&#39;s complexity. And solving the world&#39;s problems. You really can connect everything to everything else. Ex: Fungi connect to human economies.</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Joined the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://slc.blog.ryerson.ca/sandbox/\">DMZ Sandbox</a> Accelerator to learn more about startups. </li> <li>Researched the energy industry, from nuclear fusion to advanced solar panels to better batteries. </li> <li>Finished taking intro to biology in summer school. It gives me a deeper appreciation for how the world works :-) Ex: What fungal mycelium networks can teach us about human societies.</li> <li>Planning logistics of moving to Toronto.</li> </ul>",
  6: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Everyone knows something I don&#39;t. It&#39;s my job to unlock it.</strong><ul> <li>So &#39;being bored&#39; in a conversation is really my fault.</li> <li>Ex: I met one financial employee randomly. I thought I&#39;d have nothing to talk to him about... 15 minutes later, he was telling me how his work in molecular genetics led him to a job in corporate finance! WHAT?!</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>My biggest gift is the people who care for me. They NEED to come first.</strong><ul> <li>This month, I&#39;ve been travelling hundreds of kilometres every day to attend an entrepreneurship accelerator. How? With my parent&#39;s financial support (and tolerating me waking up at 5 AM). And at the accelerator, I&#39;ve been having impromptu meetings left and right everyday. Understandably, my team was frustrated. So I wrote up a <em>very</em> long apology at 1 AM and a plan to fix this. The next morning, my team-mate forgave me and she told me to just get more sleep. <strong>The only reason I am where I am today is due to others&#39; support.</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Closed doors are GOOD. They keep you from going where you don&#39;t belong</strong><ul> <li>So in the end, you keep trying a new path to get to where you enjoy and fit!</li> <li>Ex: I interviewed a consultant who left a high-paying corporate job to start a startup. Why? Because he just wasn&#39;t in the right place yet. It&#39;s that simple.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Pitched at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://dmz.ryerson.ca/\">DMZ Startup Accelerator</a> for $5K to support a project using AI to detect emerging diseases. We came in top 5!<ul> <li>Travelled 2.5 hours 2x a day too many times to count this month :O When getting to the DMZ Accelerator</li> </ul> </li> <li>Wrote some articles about renewable energy from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/fd5474b69e7d\">nuclear fusion</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/2409910cab0a\">solar panels</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/a3c4830dc1b1\">batteries</a>. </li> <li>Interviewed 20 people in 5 days :O Lessons on what I learned <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bOykbosR3i3GGW2GyVmadv8GnES5Pc3VOmOXs8emg88/edit#gid=0\">here</a></li> </ul>",
  7: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>Hard work has delayed results. But it proves useful in unexpected ways later. <ul> <li>Ex: When I was at a techology festival, I found I had lots of cool stories to share with people! And they were about tiny projects I did over the summer, like just learning about basic concepts in AI. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>In a world changing faster than ever, generalists can adapt more quickly to new roles.</strong><ul> <li>Ex: This is why it makes sense to learn multiple unrelated skills to be better than 75% of people. Compared to learning one skill to be better than 95% of people. Mulitple unrelated skills are unlikely to all go out of use at the same time. </li> </ul> </li> <li>No new success comes without sacrificing something else. <strong>It&#39;s better to be aware of that sacrifice and prepare for it rather than be surprised by it.</strong><ul> <li>Ex: Though I had a great time at hackathons and technology festivals, I had no time for friends/family. And that created lots of negativity I wasn&#39;t ready for.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Was sponsored by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tks.world/\">TKS</a> to go to Elevate</strong>, Canada&#39;s largest technology festival.<ul> <li>It was a great experience! We got to see Michelle Obama roasting Donald Trump, hear Chris Hadfield sing Space Odyssey, and meet some Olympic athletes behind the scenes :D</li> </ul> </li> <li>Took part in TD Bank&#39;s hackathon to solve problems for the community. <strong>Designed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.figma.com/proto/OjFnhKwJDmbVRuq5kL74dk/Atro-Mobile-UI-kit---Figma-%5Bfreebie%5D-(Copy\">senior-accessible</a> mobile banking apps</strong> - which was weird to see a big bank lacking?</li> <li><strong>Researched the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x9j19x1Hurfr1HWnLBqTbyQvMrqTYCf1/view?usp=sharing\">banking industry&#39;s issues with regulations</a></strong>. Well, not any specific regulation. But how it costs $500M per year to TRACK changes in regulations. </li> <li>Wrote some articles on lessons learned from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/55902482cb8\">Plato</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/6240d0822429\">Socrates</a>.

  8: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>Stoicism tidbit: <strong>if it&#39;s in my control, don&#39;t worry about it. If it&#39;s out of my control, don&#39;t worry about it.</strong> For those keeping track - just don&#39;t worry about it :D</li> <li><strong>The best relationships start without a plan</strong><ul> <li>Ex: I didn&#39;t know whether I was accepted into a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qosf.org\">hackathon</a> until the day before.

(And the Vietnamese subs were great too ;-)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Learned the basics of quantum computing at an incredibly fun <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qosf.org/\">hackathon</a>!<ul> <li>We ran an experiment on whether quantum computers or regular computers could detect flowers in images faster. My old laptop was 2600x faster than a quantum computer :D</li> </ul> </li> <li>Wrote about the commonalities between <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/@madhav.malhotra003/buddha-how-giving-up-everything-led-to-happiness-2018e4f863e9\">Buddhism</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/@madhav.malhotra003/how-an-ancient-philosopher-beat-google-to-finding-productivity-df31cd7f6eb5\">Daoism</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/@madhav.malhotra003/the-most-epic-philosopher-of-all-29e8c9a6c826\">Stoicism</a>.</li> <li>Researched the root cause of why <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IC1Vgw2WLMU1Nr7iG4NxtUJ-MbyO3IyC\">processing insurance claims</a> costs the industry $1.1B :O</li> <li>Made a video about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/Zqj_QfGvf6s\">future battery technologies</a> ;-)</li> <li>Helped decorate (dabbed paint in minor areas of) a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AFDHGWguzRx_4earV9weil4ZT-9AcqNk/view?usp=sharing\">pumpkin</a> that looks like Venom :D</li> <li>Sang the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/GBsuJHny3uo\">theme song from Moana in public</a> :O</li> </ul>",
  9: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>Life&#39;s problem&#39;s repeat themselves. So by tracking my problems, I&#39;ll have fewer nasty surprises :D <ul> <li>I learned this from Ray Dalio, who recommends <strong>tracking decisions you make to see their outcomes</strong>. That way, you can check for any common mistakes you make.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Learned about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PersonalityHackerPodcast\">personality types</a>! They let me better understand what I&#39;m strong at and weak at. <ul> <li>Ex: I use this to set goals to fix MY specific weaknesses. </li> <li>Ex: I use this to know where I&#39;m so bad I&#39;d better delegate X to others :D</li> </ul> </li> <li>Failure is a forcing function to fix what&#39;s wrong. So in a tough spot, I don&#39;t need to think: &quot;Phew... I&#39;m glad it&#39;s over.&quot; I could think: &quot;Wow... I&#39;m glad that happened!&quot;</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Pitched a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fasken.com/en/\">law-firm</a> on how to improve customer service with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.figma.com/proto/uX318JhjwrMju3giWDcNvg/PRIVATE-LEGAL-MOCKUP?node-id=483%3A55&amp;scaling=scale-down\">Salesforce</a>.</li> <li>Took part in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ethwaterloo.com/\">EthWaterloo</a> hackathon!

  10: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>Not every goal has a &#39;hack&#39;. Sometimes, it&#39;s as simple as more effort = more progress. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html\">Paul Graham</a> has useful thoughts on how to find areas that work like this.</li> <li><strong>Life doesn&#39;t owe me anything</strong><ul> <li>I applied to a standup comedy audition. Didn&#39;t get in. Felt bad because I thought of myself as a &#39;funny guy.&#39; Especially when a failure challenges my identity, I have to reduce my ego and realise I&#39;m not owed anything. And try to form less rigid identities in the future.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Watch <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://resources.madhavmalhotra.com/documentary-recommendations\">documentaries</a> about the developing world.</strong> I&#39;ll realise I have every reason in the world to be grateful.</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Made a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IVTrph6ewMaZKt12pnX_jbZ_DD5hodNZ/view\">recommendation</a> for Sidewalk Labs on how to increase access to affordable housing :-)</li> <li>Researched how <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/microgrids-how-to-prepare-energy-grids-for-the-next-superstorm-708582bdae6c\">microgrids</a> can increase energy reliability amidst growing natural disasters.<ul> <li>And <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/4-technologies-that-can-reshape-the-future-of-batteries-76db9ed7156e\">future types of batteries</a> that might be in a plane, train, or iPhone near you soon :D</li> </ul> </li> <li>Started learning Excel</li> <li>Did some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/L_kWtTwTiXo\">funny Star Wars skits</a> with a banana :D</li> <li>Survived another crazy busy exams season :O</li> </ul>",
  11: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Without effort, you can get things done. But you can&#39;t love getting them done</strong><ul> <li>Ex: The more energy I put <em>in</em> to meetings (being enthusiastic, preparing beforehand, etc.), the more I get <em>out</em> of them. Versus checking them off a todo list.</li> </ul> </li> <li>It&#39;s easy to accept what you&#39;ve never had. It&#39;s hard to give up what you previously had.<ul> <li>Ex: I&#39;ve been vegetarian my entire life. I don&#39;t &#39;miss&#39; meat - I don&#39;t even know what it tastes like :D But friends who&#39;re trying to go vegetarian for the first time - they have a lot more to give up :/</li> <li>Implication? <strong>Be careful about the comforts you let into your life</strong>. If you&#39;ve never had 6 gigabytes of cell phone data, takeout every day, a house with X bedrooms, ... you won&#39;t miss them. But if you get these things, it&#39;ll be harder to give them up. </li> </ul> </li> <li>We make mountains out of what we&#39;d rather not do. But <strong>the moment we get started, it gets easier</strong><ul> <li>Ex: Me writing a chemistry report is 6/10 boring, but me thinking about doing it is 9/10 boring :D</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Finished my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.madhavmalhotra.com/blog/2019-annual-reflection.html\">2019 annual reflection</a>.

I feel like getting any data and creating tables and charts out of it these days :D Made a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UbMjeJgTU2Su3d_XHWhyByKmqkWIZf19Jfe7M_fe2Wo/edit\">team tracker</a> to practice my skills ;-)</li> <li>Researched root causes of not having electricity access (because you don&#39;t have ID to sign up for loans to get electricity infrastructure). And for accidental deaths in hospitals (because staff don&#39;t have transfer protocols when changing who cares for a patient).<ul> <li>Also wrote an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/@madhav.malhotra003/how-to-speed-up-rural-electrification-67f03cf05bec\">article</a> on electricity access in rural areas!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Wrote about an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/@madhav.malhotra003/gratitude-the-most-surprising-superpower-6350caa49fee\">experiment</a> on finding as many things to be grateful for as possible!</li> </ul>",
  12: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>My decisions are always a bit random. So I should be less hard on myself</strong><ul> <li>No really! I can&#39;t control which next thought will come up. Ex: &quot;&quot;Think of a movie&quot;&quot; --&gt; I didn&#39;t have any control on the first movie that came to my head. Or the second, third, or fourth. So any decision I take is a little random + a little out of my control.</li> </ul> </li> <li>We can&#39;t change the world. We can change our interpretations.<ul> <li>And how we interpret an event determines how we feel! Ex: <strong>Interpreting a negative event as a challenge to grow from</strong> (fancy word: &#39;challenge appraisal&#39;) reduces negative emotions.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>All progress decays. Accept it and work with it</strong><ul> <li>Ex: I can get frustrated I don&#39;t remember how to code X. Or, I can take notes to look back on <em>accepting</em> that I&#39;ll forget what I learned soon.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Won a hackathon on how to use IoT sensors to detect leaks in oil pipelines.

But what&#39;s the point of leadership? To make successful movements? But the success of a movement is based on how many people <em>follow</em>. So <strong>go ask a friend: &quot;&quot;What cool things are you working on?

Sometimes, it&#39;s not. Ex: I like being helpful. That&#39;s good around close friends.

  15: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Someone else getting more doesn&#39;t mean I get less.</strong><ul> <li>In the modern world, there are LITERALLY countless problems to solve, careers to have, awards to win, etc. It&#39;s very rare to have people on the exact same path. Ie. If a &#39;competitor&#39; wins, that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have a chance to win.</li> </ul> </li> <li>When things go wrong, we turn to leaders.<ul> <li>I know a CEO whose company hosted an online conference. It cost $50,000. Last minute, there was a technical issue. All the staff were panicking! And everyone started messaging the CEO. From the outside, it was interesting to observe how people IMMEDIATELY turn to leaders under stress.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Our brains haven&#39;t somehow become more rational in modern times</strong><ul> <li>We might do more abstract thinking. But we still have the same biases as ever! Ex: we still have the same <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_cave_the_4_stories_we_tell_ourselves_about_death\">myths about death</a> now as cavemen did.</li> <li>Realising this with humility is the first step towards making better decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Started <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://madhavmalhotra.com/ThePlasticShift\">The Plastic Shift</a> with my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ayleen-farnood-747b9614b\">team-mate</a>. We&#39;ve <strong>created resources explaining root causes and potential solutions in plastic pollution.</strong></li> <li>Started a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKi8i0zkVlmjex0cdrMRiUQ\">podcast</a> to <strong>interview experts in plastic pollution!</strong></li> <li>Failed at pitching a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16NxaJkT85DWapV4_35GPtSZengYfqSNe/view?usp=sharing\">mobile app</a> to reduce distracted driving. Got a <strong>useful reality check on what matters to managers</strong> - not technical details. But what&#39;s propreitary, which employees are needed, and how much time/cost to expect.</li> <li>Got <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2oHW7xH-3A\">feedback</a> from a child education startup in Kenya that my team consulted for :-)</li> </ul>",
  16: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Positivity isn&#39;t about how I appear to others</strong><ul> <li>I had a lot of meetings with people where I forced myself to be enthusiastic. But this left me tired. To actually feel more &#39;positive&#39;, I had to remember I was lucky to still meet people. Ie. <strong>Real positivity comes from basic, pleasant emotions like gratitude, faith, hope, etc.</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>I judge myself more than anyone ever will</strong><ul> <li>Ex: This month, I missed a meeting with a mentor. She wasn&#39;t mad. But I never forgot that moment, even years later. This is something I need to get over if I want to grow from mistakes instead of wallowing in them.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>I have problems running amok in my head. And that makes me lucky.</strong><ul> <li>Some have to worry about finding enough food, shelter, water, medication, etc. to live. But I only have to worry about writing forty pages of essays. I&#39;m lucky I only have to deal with problems in my head :-)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Spoke at a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDswb_1l2XU\">webinar</a> on plastic pollution by The Ellen MacArthur Foundation!</li> <li>Created some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhavmalhotra.com/ThePlasticShift/infographics.html\">infographics</a> explaining the basics of plastic pollution.<ul> <li>And helped Plastic Bank create some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/175_BUpmZedTG3Temz9pzgWsK1AvG3c-D_OMhhwkTs6k/edit?usp=sharing\">presentations</a> explaining the problem to youth.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Recorded <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/4wjMEfWrc3c\">podcasts</a> with chemists, marine biologists, and waste management experts from Norway to Mexico. </li> <li>Won a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.agorize.com/en/challenges/td-insurance-2020\">TD Insurance hackathon</a> with an idea on how to keep youth drivers safer, while also reducing costs! It was very unexpected, since we snuck in as the only highschool team amidst 150 university teams :D</li> <li>Wrote a few blog posts on lessons we can learn from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.madhavmalhotra.com/survivors-of-the-rubble.html\">Syrian refugees</a>, why it&#39;s hard to understand the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhavmalhotra.com/cycle-of-failure.html\">value of failure</a> when young, and how to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhavmalhotra.com/hang-glider-theory.html\">keep our options open</a> in life.</li> </ul>",
  17: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Career is not equal to identity</strong><ul> <li>When I ask people who they are, they tell me what they do.

Do my work, then step back.</strong><ul> <li>I can easily stress about when scholarship decisions come out, when mentors will email back, when team-mates will finish their part... But I can&#39;t control any of that. Do my work, then move on. They work on their own schedule.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>Started a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRBGFeAh48DcVIFQ11OFw1g\">podcast</a> with my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ayleen-farnood-747b9614b\">team-mate</a> to interview specialised researchers!<ul> <li>I was interviewing experts in plastic pollution and realised how there were so many niche areas of knowledge I&#39;d never heard of.

  18: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>What I work on &gt; how hard I work</strong> - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/naval/status/738857029108797440?lang=en\">Naval Ravikant</a><ul> <li>Growing up, I often prided my work ethic. But as I work on more projects, I&#39;ve realised that I CAN work hard on the wrong things. Ex: Imagine Elon Musk used his determination to be a great accountant :D</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>It&#39;s the people that say yes to opportunities.</strong> <ul> <li>The most influential work ALWAYS involves multiple people. Learning to work together is thus inevitable. No matter how nerve-wracking it can sometimes be for an introvert :D</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>If it&#39;s not fun, I won&#39;t do it</strong>. <ul> <li>Ex: I researched <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhavmalhotra.com/ThePlasticShift\">plastic pollution</a> for 6 months, mainly because I enjoyed being around <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayleen-farnood-747b9614b\">my team-mate</a> :D</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Finished learning React.

  19: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Sometimes, a step back is better than a step forward</strong><ul> <li>Ex: When I had to stop <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://madhavmalhotra.com/ThePlasticShift\">researching plastic pollution</a> after 4 months of no clear next steps.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>There are many correct ways to see reality. I have to choose the most useful.</strong><ul> <li>Ex: In physics, you can solve problems with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system\">polar coordinates</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system\">cartesian coordinates</a>. For circular motion, polar coordinates are more convenient!</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>I can&#39;t be successful when I haven&#39;t defined success.</strong><ul> <li>This isn&#39;t some academic wordplay. I mean it practically! Writing down the person I&#39;m aiming to become in whatever time period is SO useful. Whenever I feel demotivated, I come back to that. And it&#39;s an easy way to find out what to do next.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Interviewing several sustainable startups</strong> about the biggest problems they face. Wrote some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/music-and-microbiology-a-case-study-from-nyoka-labs-2c8e80f98f37\">case studies</a> on what I learned!</li> <li><strong>Interviewed 13 researchers</strong> on my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRBGFeAh48DcVIFQ11OFw1g\">podcast</a>.

  20: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>People make the world go around.</strong> And not just from their work.<ul> <li>Ex: Who keeps me <em>happy enough</em> to work <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness\">all my life</a>?</li> <li>Ex: Who are the people who said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/aCuXgyI5wh0?t=1457\">one sentence</a> that completely changed my perspective on the world?</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>The universe doesn&#39;t owe me anything</strong><ul> <li>Many of our problems with the &#39;world&#39; are really problems with &#39;our expectations of the world&#39;.

Biggest lesson? <strong>People like stories a lot more than advice :D</strong></li> <li>Learned some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/69fKNJuhdAY\">negotiation basics</a>. Ex: Focusing on &#39;interests&#39; &gt; &#39;positions&#39; (why they want X vs. what they want). </li> <li><strong>Failed at winning a scholarship</strong>.

  21: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>We can&#39;t turn back time.</strong> <ul> <li>I know this, but don&#39;t act like it. Ex: When I daydream about being a child again. Ex: When I wish a relationship were different like before.</li> <li>The solution? To learn to adapt to/accept the present.

  22: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>So many of our thoughts are just planning for the future and reminiscing about the past. </li> <li><strong>These days right NOW... these are the good old days I’ll look back on.</strong><ul> <li>It&#39;s all a unique mix of experiences in time that I&#39;ll never get back</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>If I find I&#39;m always right, I&#39;m not making hard enough decisions.</strong></li> <li><strong>Employees see their work as a task.

  23: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li>If I don’t care about myself, I won’t grow. I won’t even want to live. <ul> <li><strong>Self-esteem is the prerequisite to ANY success.</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Schedule time to do nothing</strong>. Just stop and think.<ul> <li>I’ll find new perspectives on old problems.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Don’t make decisions while feeling negative</strong>. Wait a day. </li> <li>Don’t be a victim. Self-pity makes me unhappy. It doesn’t solve problems. <ul> <li>Instead of whining, ask: <strong>&quot;&quot;What’s the first step to fixing this?”</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li>If I feel upset, say: <strong>“This too shall pass.” Nothing matters as much as I think in the long run</strong></li> <li><strong>Placebos are practical</strong>. If it feels good, it works!<ul> <li>Point at myself and laugh for no reason.</li> <li>Imagine <strong>an alien is in front of me. It has the EXACT same problems as me.

I’ll start smiling and you can have better sights to see! Win win!”</li> </ul> </li> <li>I don’t need to be in control to feel calm. <strong>If I accept what’s out of my control, I’ll also feel calm</strong>.<ul> <li>Ex: Relationship issues: “They’re going to [verb] and it’s out of my control.

Ex: <strong>Set a timer and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app\">don&#39;t stop writing</a>.</strong></li> <li>Venting emotions to others is a healthy habit.</li> <li>To get to 10x better, ask: <strong>“What can X do that can’t be done anywhere else?”</strong></li> <li>To listen well, I have to WANT to listen. I&#39;ll want to listen if I&#39;m asking questions that lead to interesting answers. Ask:<ul> <li><strong>“What’s the most surprising thing you learned about this week?”</strong></li> <li><strong>“What’s something [adjective] you do that most others don’t?”</strong></li> <li><strong>“What’s a big challenge you’ve faced that shapes who you are today?”</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li>Immediately after negativity, reflect: <strong>“How can I grow from this?”</strong></li> <li><strong>When thanking, complimenting, encouraging, etc. - add SPECIFIC details</strong>.</li> <li>Keep giving till I learn to stop expecting something in return. Ex: <strong>Thank someone every day</strong>.</li> <li>Usually, I fear what others think. Not failure. <ul> <li><strong>To overcome the fear of what others think, do tiny things to look ridiculous</strong>. Ex: Wear a tie with a sports shirt.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Self-confidence is based on intention, not results. <ul> <li><strong>Before starting a task, do a positive affirmation about my intention</strong>. Ex: “I will pursue this out of curiosity and will persist even if there are setbacks.”</li> </ul> </li> <li>Avoid preprepared questions in meetings. <strong>Ask followups whenever possible.</strong></li> <li><strong>Ask: “WHY am I feeling [negative emotion]?” Curiosity dissipates negativity.</strong></li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Started teaching a course on AI starting with grade 8 math</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqgr5FD_y_wLYetqEkzc68eReW2gHK14Q\">here</a></li> <li>Volunteering at a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://terraoptima.ca/\">startup</a> to make <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rRZ7ocCgJ5Z8mmdlc8DyFeFb4hUxDWtM/view?usp=sharing\">3D models</a> of composting systems</li> <li>Training to be a speaker at a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jack.org/\">mental health nonprofit</a></li> <li>4 speaking challenges: a history presentation, two skits, and reading children&#39;s books <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0PsdWnY7Ec&amp;list=PLqgr5FD_y_wLuR5DMQCRNQN0UYNab983G&amp;index=5\">here</a></li> <li>Researched 4 speakers: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://quizlet.com/ca/649001197/\">Oprah Winfrey</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://quizlet.com/ca/645654600/\">Cal Fussman</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://quizlet.com/ca/643587057/\">Ben Shapiro</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://quizlet.com/ca/641175196/\">Christopher Hitchens</a>.</li> <li>Made <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://resources.madhavmalhotra.com/health-notes\">notes</a> on how to fix dozens of health and mental health issues.</strong></li> <li>Researched childhood trauma in 27 influential historical figures. <strong>Wrote an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://madhav-malhotra003.medium.com/all-greatness-comes-from-suffering-3a39d85ca77d\">article</a> on how &#39;heros&#39; are as vulnerable as all of us.</strong></li> </ul>",

In just 40 mins :D Now, I&#39;m a speaker there. Suits my personal goals :-)</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Be vulnerable first</strong>. Ex: In a call, share a personal story first. Ex: Ask a new friend for their address to send a christmas gift first.</li> <li><strong>Curiosity dissipates conflict</strong>. When mad, ask: &quot;Why am I mad?&quot;</li> <li><strong>At the start of the day, make a todo list. Write WHY I&#39;m doing each todo. Write which part of each task holds most value. Do that first. Identify which task has least priority. Do that last or don&#39;t do that. Work in 15-minute sprints (set a timer). After each sprint, check if still on task.</strong><ul> <li>For work. Not for relationships/fun. Ex: not for a call with friend.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Intentionally make tiny mistakes in front of others</strong>. Less ego<ul> <li>Ex: leave bug in code while showing it to others. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Work on what&#39;s possible &gt; what I&#39;d like</strong>. Less stress.<ul> <li>Ex: I had house repairs one day. Just set one goal. </li> <li>Ex: Had bugs in website. Asked: <strong>&quot;What&#39;s the cost of fixing it now?&quot;</strong> That I might not publish this reflection. So I left the bug.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Meditate/listen to calming music before calls.</strong> Less stress = more authenticity, enthusiasm.</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"what-i-did\">What I did</h3> <ul> <li>Wrote annual reflection on lessons learned in 2021 (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.madhavmalhotra.com/blog/2021-Annual-Reflection/index.html\">here</a>)</li> <li>Finished teaching a course on AI starting with grade 9 math (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYQnyfLeI8g&amp;list=PLqgr5FD_y_wLYetqEkzc68eReW2gHK14Q\">here</a>)</li> <li>Recorded podcasts with an e-waste researcher.

  35: "<h3 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Take notes, even during personal meetings.

Turns the bad into good :-)</li> <li>Stop being hard on myself after failure. That&#39;s not discipline, that&#39;s irrational.<ul> <li>Instead, <strong>ask: &quot;&quot;What should I change to fix this?&quot;&quot;</strong>. Use failure to get lessons for the future.</li> <li>In general, what am I getting lessons for if not for future use?!? <strong>Take notes more.</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li>It&#39;s <strong>easy to confuse &#39;less convenient&#39; options with &#39;harder&#39; options</strong>.
