        ## Travels

        I'm surprised looking back at how nervous I was when I first got to Qu√©bec. I didn't feel comfortable speaking French and I didn't really know what to expect. I tend to go 0 to 100 real quick in a lot of domains. I guess that includes "easing into" my first solo trip &#128517;
        
        I remember feeling nervous as I paid thousands of dollars for my AirBnB (my first purchase that large) thinking: "Wow, am I really doing this? There's literally nothing to determine whether to press the button other than what my heart decides." 

        <blockquote>Foreshadowed lesson: press the @\#(\*\#@$ button\!</blockquote>

        As I arrived in Qu√©bec, tiny things started to go right to ease my nervousness. First off, I was living in such a lucky middlespot between Universit√© Laval and Vieux Qu√©bec. My hosts were kind enough to lend me their bike, so I biked everywhere. **Every destination had a journey of literal effort behind it. It made me appreciate each expedition that much more**. I was especially lucky that Ghislain and Brigitte lived right on a bike-only road. So I'd just explore \- start riding in one direction to see how far the road went and then do the same in the other.

        <figcaption>Pont de Qu√©bec to the East. It's nice to bike to next to the river :-)</figcaption> 

        ![Random grass-covered house](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/quebec/GrassyHouseTrim.webp) 
        <figcaption>Pretty house en route to Universit√© Laval to the West. It reminded me of Lord of the Rings &#128513;</figcaption> 
        
        Warning: Qu√©bec used to be a fortress built on top of a hill. I'd ask Google Maps to show me a nearby grocery store. It'd show me one just a kilometre away, so I'd go biking off happily\! Little did I know I'd end up carrying a bike AND groceries up and down "les escaliers de la pente douce" (The stairs of the "soft" slope &#128558;)
        
        ![Escaliers de la pente not so douce](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/quebec/EscaliersTrim.webp)
        <figcaption>Escaliers de la pente not so douce if you'll pardon my French &#128517;</figcaption>

        Sidenote: you don't know true embarrassment until you're at the grocery store holding up people at the self-checkout and you realise you don't know how to say "kale" in French and then the associate comes over like "T'as besoin de l'aide?" and you're like "Yes, but I don't know how to ask you for the help I need because I wasn't paying attention during the Duolingo lesson on kale &#128557;" and then you just stand there awkwardly as he just pieces together the situation and he's like "Ahh, chou-frise" &#128128;&#128558;&#128557;

        One time I decided to bike 25 km to Marais du Nord. That was an interesting decision &#128517; The marsh was okay. The post-trip leg pains were monumental &#128558;   
        
        ![Marais du Nord](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/quebec/MaraisTrim.webp)
        <figcaption>Marais du Nord. Very Game of Thrones name. Nice birds, horrible mosquitos ;-;</figcaption>

        That said, I also stopped at the Huron-Wendat museum while I was to the north of Charlesbourg. I forced myself to get the French tour even though I was nervous. I couldn't understand how rapidly my guide Daphn√© spoke at first. Surprisingly, I got used to it after a while! 
        
        I'm glad I got into that habit. Turns out that I really like guided tours! I didn't know this since my family doesn't like staying long at museums. And I wouldn't even have tried a single one without my goal of learning French. I kept doing French tours throughout the rest of my trip. 
        
        One sidenote for you: if you're in Canada and you speak French \- you're MUCH more likely to get private tours. Especially if you go to places on rainy days where all the local francophones are too smart to show up &#128517;

        ## Brigitte and Ghislain

        Brigitte and Ghislain were basically the best hosts I could ask for. I really felt more like I was with a host family than with AirBnB hosts! 
        
        Brigitte was very mothering since they also had their own daughters just ten years older than me. Ghislain was the most 30-year-old-seeming 60-year-old you've never met in your life üòÆ I was a developer and he worked in business. So I'd try to simplify what I did when describing my work to him. Then, he'd surprise me by talking about failures in cryptographic security with the advent of quantum computers and I'd be like :OOOOO

        </button>

        We were lucky enough to have dinner together twice. Nevermind the "you're only as good as your training" BS. I rose up to the occasion\! Prettiest meals I've ever cooked for someone on the very first time I tried &#128513;   
        
        ![Aesthetic dinner](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/quebec/DinnerTrim.webp)  
        <figcaption>I basically never take photos of food so pardon the underwhelming backdrop</figcaption>

        I have such a heartwarming lovely picture of us at the last dinner, even though I forgot to look at the camera :/ Also, turns out they quite like Indian food. As I've already noted in life, thank the universe for Indian food: one of the most universal ways to make friends &#128517; 
        
        The dinners also let us talk about the more personal stuff like politics. I was quite surprised how much a twenty year old zoomer and sixty year old boomers can have in common! All things considered, I'm even more glad and lucky to have met Brigitte and Ghislain now than when I started the trip :-)

        ## Meeting Students

        I had a pretty hard time meeting students to be honest. Most of the clubs I found were pretty inactive. The entire university was summarised to me as "vide" (empty) during the summer. 
        
        I did see a random facebook post for a group mural painting activity thingy and just randomly showed up. To my great chagrin, the activity combined three fears all at once: talking to girls, talking to pretty girls, and talking to pretty girls in French &#128558; Anyways, No√©mie and Laurence were much more talented at drawing than I was. Laurence drew this incredible supernova sunset. I drew the fake "symbole chinois" since they didn't bother to ask for details &#128517;  
        
        ![Mural at Universit√© de Laval](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/quebec/UniLavalTrim.webp) 
        <figcaption>I like to play a game where I ask people to guess which one I drew. No one's ever guessed right &#128513;</figcaption>

        I also got to meet Nathaniel from the AI club at Universit√© Laval. That was nice. I finally had my "talk to someone about the oncoming AI singularity" conversation of the trip &#128517; It was interesting how different our viewpoints were. It was one of many times where I met people and thought: "**Hey, this person lives life totally differently than me. I appreciate learning something new here\! But boy, I would not like to have their life &#128517;**" I will say, though, Nathaniel seemed a lot more happy and focused on the present. I wish him good luck with his grad studies ~~and running from the AI overlords :D~~  
        
        Also, funny story \- my French was @\#($\!) as usual with Nathaniel, but I managed to communicate. Over time, I built up confidence and started talking to the other people visiting Nathaniel's club (we were at a science fair type event). I proceeded to give this one girl a fluent French intro to the club, felt so proud, and then her mom starts talking to her in English with an American accent and I feel like a dunce realising they're Ohlahomians who didn't understand a word of what I'd said &#128557; Though I perked right up after hearing Nathaniel giving them instructions in English and realising his English was just as @\#$@& as my French &#128513;

        # Winnipeg

        ## Inequity

        I lived in one of the worst parts of town in Winnipeg. If you left a car on the street, it'd be smashed the next day. If you left your door unlocked, someone would vandalise the place. There were boarded up windows, shuttered-down businesses, rows of homeless people sitting on main street, alleyways of people doing drugs, people walking around half-naked with no shoes, and more. One block seemed like Canada and the next seemed like a third-world country.  
        <img class="vert" src="/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/winnipeg/brokenDoor.webp" alt="A broken door" />
        <figcaption>Nothing special about this break-in. One of many on my part of main street.</figcaption> 

        Within 100m of this, there were rows of non-profits with paradoxical messages about hope and museums selling indigenous-branded paraphernalia for tourists. It all seemed like some sort of dystopian joke, given the vast majority of the homeless population was indigenous. 
        
        When I went to BC, museums about indigenous culture would get complaints about cultural appropriation from totem poles being placed everywhere like trophies. In Winnipeg, cultural appropriation was the least of people's problems.   
        <img class="vert" src="/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/winnipeg/amongUs.webp" alt="Ancestors Among Us T-shirt at a Museum" />
        
        I don't mention any of the above to complain about Winnipeg. I'm really glad I went to Winnipeg so I could see how enormous of a difference there can be in the day-to-day reality of two Canadians. **Inequality exists everywhere; in the place I lived, the inequality was just more stark**. A librarian I met at the University of Winnipeg summarised it perfectly: "Are you unsafe, or do you *feel* unsafe?" 
        
        I was uncomfortable, but I was learning. I share this experience hoping that more people know about these hidden corners in the country that don't get talked about enough. I certainly learned about experiences of indigenous Canadians that were NEVER mentioned in any of the museums I went to.

        ## David

        I learned a lot from my AirBnB host. We shared a lot of personal stories about challenges faced in the different environments we grew up. I really appreciated that David reinforced the importance of listening and not assuming that everyone has the same goals/problems as me. It was one of many times I saw the dual paradox that **humans of very different backgrounds end up simultaneously different and alike. It just matters where you look**. 

        On a more playful note, I chose to stay at David's place since I'd been scared of dogs after one clawed me as a kid. David fostered dogs so there was always a puppy looking to be pet :-) I really took to one of the dogs, who we called Bear since he had the size (and fur) of a teenage black bear. We don't know exactly what he was, but he looked like a giant version of a [German Spitz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn-origin-etr.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24152054/German-Spitz-standing-in-profile-outdoors.jpg).   
        
        The one thing that summarised Bear was that he loved attention &#128517; Whenever I came into the house, he'd jump up and put his paws on my chest and just stay there waiting for pets. Every morning, I'd here a bump on my door and he'd just lay outside like a giant carpet until I went out to pet him. David had a glass dinner table, which was unhelpful because he'd just sit underneath the table and stare up at me through the glass with puppy dog eyes begging for food. Very hard to get work done with Bear around, but I miss him &#129394;

        ## Dr. Bruce and the Herbaria

        When I visited the University of Manitoba, the Faculty of Science encouraged people to visit their herbarium. I didn't know what a herbarium was, but I saw a room number and started knocking on doors &#128513; By chance, I ran into the retired curator of the herbarium, Dr. Bruce, late on a Friday afternoon. Dr. Bruce introduced me to the hidden world of herbaria for the rest of my trip\!

        A herbarium is a collection of dried plant (and potentially fungal) specimens. The plants are dried and pressed into pages, where they can be stored for over a century.   
        ![Herbarium specimens from a public dataset](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/winnipeg/herbarium.webp)  
        <figcaption>Specimens from public datasets on Zenodo \- <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/1480546" target="_blank">left</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/1483766" target="_blank">right</a></figcaption>

        The University of Manitoba's Herbarium had specimens which were over 100 years old, including holotypes. Holotypes are the 'reference' global standard to define a species for all of science! Dr. Bruce collected some holotypes himself through his global travels. In particular, he identified new species of grasses in Vietnam. I thought it was the coolest job I'd never heard of, so I took up Dr. Bruce's suggestion to visit the herbaria at other universities I went to\! 

        In Saskatoon, I went to the University of Saskatchewan and found a much larger herbarium whose specialty was sunflower-like plants. Turns out most sunflowers are SO much smaller than the stuff you see growing in gardens. The curator, Denver, had actually come _back_ from a trip to Toronto, while I was coming _in_ from Toronto. So we had fun conversations about travelling. He also took the time to explain the challenges of digitising the herbaria collections so that centuries worth of data could be used for more studies. 

        <button data-src="/blog/2024-summer-travels/audio/winnipeg/Herbarium nerds (50s).mp3" class="narration-button">
            Herbaria digitisation nerds
        </button>

        After Saskatoon, I went to the University of Alberta's Herbarium in Edmonton. I went to the non-vascular herbarium in particular, which focused on fungi and plants called bryophytes. There, I was again lucky enough to run into the retired curator, Dr. Catherine. She told me how she and her husband often did studies in the Arctic. I was fascinated by the travel involved in her work. She was fascinated by the plants &#128517; 
        
        I asked her about how she wanted to spend her time in retirement and she told me how she'd much rather spend time analysing her herbarium samples than travelling or picking up everyday hobbies. Like I said, herbarium curators are some of the most unique people in the world! I say this jokingly, but serious respect to them. It's a level of patience and willingness to follow your passion like no other.

        I finally went to the herbarium at the University of British Columbia. It's in the Beaty Biodiversity Museum, alongside animal specimens. If you're looking for an easy-to-get-to herbarium, you just have to pay money and not talk to anyone to get in there. It does have a giant blue whale skeleton that's interesting. Though I didn't like it much personally since I didn't get to talk to any curators. **Turns out I was more interested in studying the people studying the plants than studying the plants themselves &#128513;**

        ## A Very Cute City

        One lesson that quickly became obvious in my trip was 'High expectations, low happiness. Low expectations, high happiness.' And in Saskatoon, I had no expectations soooo &#128517; 
        
        I didn't want to stop in Saskatoon. I was planning to head to Edmonton and it just happened that Saskatoon made sense as a stop geographically. As it turns out, Saskatoon was my favourite *destination* throughout the trip\!

        The city has a population similar to Waterloo, where I study. Though I'm blown away by how much more *scenic* Saskatoon is\! In the middle of the city is the South Saskatchewan river. There's a pretty linear park around the river (great place for morning strolls) and lots of aesthetic bridges. Every evening, people go canoeing off of River's Landing. That's right next to my favourite museum from the entire trip: the Remai Modern. (More rantage on this in the Arts section &#128548;)  
        ![River's landing next to the Remai Modern](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/saskatoon/riversLanding.webp) 
        <figcaption>River's landing next to the Remai Modern</figcaption>

        Downtown Saskatoon is quaint and still walkable. There are pretty murals around and lots of e-scooters if you want to try riding for the first time. If you're the kind of spontaneous person that just sees a small shop or cinema and walks in to see what happens, try walking down 20th St W near Avenue C South.

        ## The Farm Kids

        The University of Saskatchewan was nice to visit, albeit empty during the summer term. Luckily, when the students were away, I was able to talk to Mike, who coordinated the engineering student design teams. He told me about his decades seeing technological change at the university. In older days, the big agricultural city used to primarily get engineering students who grew up on farms from neighbouring towns. Agricultural companies would come to the university to specifically recruit students of this background. They knew they were hiring some of the most hands-on engineers in the country. 

        <button data-src="/blog/2024-summer-travels/audio/saskatoon/Group will (1.75m).mp3" class="narration-button">
            The New Gods
        </button>

        These days, there's more and more software automation in farm equipment and it's becoming much harder for any farmer to repair their equipment themselves. There are fewer 'farm kids' from neighbouring towns and more students from urban cities all around the world. Personally, I felt a little sad hearing this. 
        
        It made me think about how increasing globalisation around the world is making the numbers look better. More profits, yield, ‚Ä¶ Though we keep losing the special skills that people of different origins would develop as everyone becomes increasingly similar. To me, **it feels like the heat death of the universe; when there's no diversity, when everything is the same, everything feels stagnant.** There's nothing re*mark*able when everything's the same. Yes, the numbers look better, but does life *feel* more worth living when there's less and less to discover?

        ## Tosin

        At my AirBnB, my flatmates were a Nigerian couple. They both seemed young and the wife, Funke, told me she was doing her masters. So I assumed they were just students like me. One day, I'm talking to the husband, Tosin, and he told me he was 38\! He'd already had a multiyear career as a dentist in Nigeria and had moved to Canada to be with his wife. He did that despite his credentials no longer being accepted; he had to make ends meet as a menial labourer. 

        Having immigrated to Canada with my family, I tried to share some tips that had helped my family settle down. I was just following my natural tendencies. Still, Tosin trusted me a lot more after he saw I was trying to help without anything in it for me. It led us to the lucky position where I was able to ask him about how he stayed motivated to keep going despite all the stresses his family faced as recent immigrants. 

        Tosin told me about the huge role of faith in helping him through difficult moments in his life. He then started encouraging me to start investigating which god is real so I could come to the right conclusion. Given my background being in between many worlds, the topic of the conversation made me very uncomfortable. Though instead of making an excuse to get out of what made me uncomfortable, I made one of many great decisions throughout my journey to lean into discomfort. 
        
        I asked Tosin more about if he'd thought a lot about which god to believe in. That led us to have a much deeper conversation where he shared his doubts about faith as a teenager and how the challenges of poverty when he was my age made him start to read about different religions of the world a lot more. It gave me a much richer understanding of how dynamic people can be throughout life and the anchors of hope/community for many humans all around the world.

        Sometimes in life, you note yourself sailing into an unknown horizon with the assumptions holding you up sinking beneath your feet. Sometimes you have the ability to steer and sometimes you don't. You could turn around the raft if you do. You'd be comfortable that way. Stable that way. 
        
        Though I'd recommend you **hold your breath and plunge in the water every time you have that control. You'll see a new world on the other side**.

        # Edmonton

        ![Gallery at the Royal Alberta Museum](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/edmonton/royalAlbertaMuseum.webp)
        <figcaption>Gallery at the Royal Alberta Museum. It was nice to sit in the hall underneath the banners of massive mountains.</figcaption>

        I guess the lack of memories I have in Edmonton is telling. The problem isn't that I was only in Edmonton for three days; I loved spending just three hours in Jasper (more in the next section). Unfortunately, I just didn't meet that many people in Edmonton. 
        
        Instead, a bunch of my time was spent on touristy activities. Sure, West Edmonton Mall had unique parts. I went go kart racing, saw a ship, and saw an ice skating rink \- all indoors &#129300; Still, I just checked things off and forgot about them.   
        ![An indoor mini waterpark at the West Edmonton Mall](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/edmonton/edmontonMall.webp)
        <figcaption>An indoor mini waterpark at the West Edmonton Mall. Why not.</figcaption>

        The only touristy activity that I did appreciate in a marked way was visiting the Royal Alberta Museum. Not even all of it; I spent two hours in their temporary exhibition on the history of Cambodia and twenty minutes speedrunning the rest &#128513; I'd never looked into Cambodian culture before and the things the exhibit taught me were incredible\! 

        * I was staggered to see the monumental medieval-age city planning. Angkor had the world's largest enclosed water reservoirs during its medieval era. To this day, the traces of this engineering are still visible from overhead LIDAR\! I'd never realised cities of that scale existed in medieval Asia.  
        
        ![LIDAR image of Angkor](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/edmonton/cambodiaLidar.webp)
        <figcaption>LIDAR image of Angkor. Even with only the stone remnants, the massive engineering feats from hundreds of years ago are still visible.</figcaption>
        
        * I was staggered to see the influence of Hinduism in Cambodia. My parents are Hindu so I always just associated Hinduism as this 'private family' thing. To see how it influenced geopolitics in countries outside of India really shook my assumptions. I saw sculptures that had been broken so pillagers could steal gemstones or remove faces from statues and it angered me personally. Just looking on at the exhibition, I had this desire to see temples like Angkor Wat in their prime before the fall of the Khmer empire. It's like I could emotionally 'feel' history and the passage of time in this way I'd never felt before.

        I think **one of the signs of a good education is questioning not only the world, but how you see yourself fit in it.** Growing up as an immigrant, I'd never really strongly felt any cultural beliefs. Neither here nor there. People with identities and strong cultural beliefs seemed irrational. 'Culture' was a slightly bland word. 
        
        For the first time at this exhibition, I felt all the "irrationality" coursing through me and I appreciated it\! What someone of a different background would dismiss as a boring stroll around some old, broken rocks held two hours of meaningful inquiry for me. It gives me hope that maybe the whole 'fitting in' thing isn't some lost endeavour I should cynically dismiss. Maybe I've just been looking for the culture and beliefs that speak to me too close to home.

        # Interlude A: Talking to Strangers

        ![Train heading west into sunset near Winnipeg](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/strangers/trainNight.webp)
        <figcaption>Train heading west into sunset near Winnipeg. I went up to the dome car every night to see the sunset :-)</figcaption>

        This is a tribute to all the fantastic human beings I learned from while (technically not?) on the road.

        ## The Mother

        The first stranger I met was on my plane from Toronto to Winnipeg. The woman next to me was an immigrant from Nigeria who had just finished her masters and was now starting her first job in Canada. Since she was a student, I thought she'd graduated recently like me. As I talked to her, I come to find out that she was in fact 40 and already a mother &#128558;
        
        <button data-src="/blog/2024-summer-travels/audio/strangers/Tech support (15s).mp3" class="narration-button">
            Sample size equals two
        </button>

        I asked her about her family and she told me about how she'd split up from her husband and her son was still living with him in Nigeria. She said she didn't want to bring him to Canada until she was settled because she didn't want him to see her struggle. Now that she'd finished her masters, it was her chance to be able to support him and finally see him after two years. 

        I've often seen ambitious people around me looking down on "normal people." People who just want to get a degree don't have goals and are just looking for security. 

        Or maybe not. 

        Maybe some of us don't always see smiling faces and open doors. 

        Maybe some of us just can't imagine the pain of not seeing their child for years as they claw their way out of hardship. 

        **Maybe some of us are ambitious and privileged, while others are ambitious and not.** 

        ## The French

        I made more friends in two hours on a train because I could speak French than I did in all my time in Qu√©bec while surrounded by francophones. Let's just say, when someone's in foreign territory and **when you're the only one who can speak their language, you might be a 5/10 on a great day, but you're an absolute oasis in a desert on that day &#128517;**

        Jokes aside, for the first time in life, I felt like it was SO easy to make friends. Whenever I'd hear someone speaking French in Western Canada, I'd throw in a "Vous venez d'o√π?" and it was off to the races :-) 

        In Winnipeg, I met my housemate, Morgan, who was taking a break from the frustrations of French academia to explore all of Canada. She wasn't so confident in her English, but also so eager to learn. Often, people won't want to correct others with language mistakes in fear of seeming rude. I have the perspective of a language learner who wishes so badly that others would correct them to help them learn. So I helped Morgan with her English in that way, which helped us connect more\! We continued our separate journeys, but one day, she hopes to come back to Canada and work full time as a teacher. 

        En route to Saskatoon, I met a couple, Fran√ßois and Rafaelle, taking a break from work to explore Jasper. They got there a month before it burned down; I got there three weeks before it burned down and took a spontaneous and much appreciated three-hour sunrise hike with a retiree from West Virginia I met on the halfway mark. We were all graced by unimaginable luck as we explored this beautiful setting at sunrise before a horrifying set of events.  
        ![Lake Beauvert at 7 AM near Jasper](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/strangers/jasperLake.webp)
        <figcaption>Lake Beauvert at 7 AM on a spontaneous hike near Jasper.</figcaption>

        </button>

        Anyways, Rafaelle and Fran√ßois introduced me to another French friend they made on the train, Marianne. At my random suggestion, we all started playing Uno with me trying to explain my friendship-destroying rules in broken French and Fran√ßois scaring the daylights out of me by asking me questions with a perfect English accent before revealing that half his family was Scottish &#128561; &#128517;

        After an interlude in Edmonton, I got back on my way to Vancouver. On the BC ferry, I swear I must have a French magnet or something. I was on the aft deck, facing gale force winds, missing all the whale sightings, but somehow managing to strike up a conversation with the only Frenchman on deck &#128513; This Monsieur used to be an electrotechnician at a hydroelectric dam in France and was now road tripping across North America with his wife. I was freezing cold in jeans and jacket, but still trying to be sociable nonetheless. He was OUT-OF-HIS-MIND COLD in shorts, but still the allure of finding someone to speak your language transcends physical comfort I guess?

        I'm very appreciative of all the strangers willing to lend me an ear throughout this trip. My plans to spend an exchange term in France have now been cancelled. Please don't take offense \- all of you were so lovely that I couldn't imagine any more learning or any better an experience ahead  :-)

        ## The Swiss

        Out of all my time actively *moving* from one place to another, my favourite experience was the train from Edmonton to Vancouver. It was a 2-day train ride and I felt a bit bored when the train got past the main stop, Jasper. Eventually, I convinced myself to do a discomfort challenge and go talk to the passenger who'd stepped on board in Edmonton with me: Heidi, a grandmother from Switzerland taking her first trip since retirement. 

        Now, you'd think that a 21-year old brown male from India and a grandmother-year-old white female from Switzerland wouldn't have very much in common. Certainly, I felt a bit nervous just approaching her for no reason other than "I'm bored, will you talk to me?" &#128073;&#128072; Though as soon as I got out of my head and started listening to her, Heidi and I became excellent friends with a lot in common :-) 

        Immediately, I sensed Heidi was a bit nervous and timid talking to me. Her English wasn't perfect, so starting the conversation already was a big step for her. As soon as I heard she was Swiss, I offered to speak to her in French. As it turns out, Heidi's from the German-speaking part of Switzerland, so that was more of a step backward instead of forward, since now both of us didn't fully understand how to say what we wanted to say &#128517; Still, despite the language and cultural barrier, both of us benefited a lot from overpowering the nervousness and talking to each other :-) It taught me how people of different origins/stages of life can experience similar challenges and growth.

        Throughout the journey, Heidi told me more about her grandchildren in Switzerland and how this was her first big trip since retirement, including her first time back in Canada after several decades. I told her about all the wonderful people I'd met on my travels. We taught each other card games in a mix of English, French, and German to pass the time. Our wagon's very funny steward from Qu√©bec, Dann√©, pretended to be offended when he discovered we could speak French but talked to him in English &#128513;

        Later in the trip, we hit peak beauty when we hit the driest region of British Columbia. It was like we'd miraculously arrived in a world of badlands in [Steelhead Provincial Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Steelhead+Provincial+Park/@50.7562843,-120.8672523,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x5480258a9ad2f4cf:0xfad1b3451316ffaa!8m2!3d50.7562843!4d-120.8646774!16zL20vMGM2bDd0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) near Kamloops. It was 42 degrees celsius, so we didn't dare step outside, but the dome viewing car offered plenty of nice views :-)  

        <button data-src="/blog/2024-summer-travels/audio/strangers/The dome car (25s).mp3" class="narration-button">

        ![A collage of the badlands in Steelhead Provincial Park](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/strangers/badLandsCollage.webp)
        <figcaption>A collage of the badlands in Steelhead Provincial Park. Unexpected jewel in the middle of nowhere.</figcaption>

        In that *single* dome car, there were 5 people from Switzerland to my great surprise :-) I introduced Heidi to Marcus and Theresa, a retired couple on vacation. Marcus was an economist by training who'd worked a lot in public policy and was asked to be the mayor of his village in Switzerland before he retired. I'd never met a mayor before, so I was quite full of questions. If you don't know, Switzerland has one of the best train systems in the world. Though as it turns out, the behind-the-scenes transportation politics are quite extensive &#128064;

        After a *very* lovely train ride, we finally got to Vancouver at around 5 AM the next morning. The bags were delayed and Heidi needed to figure out how to get to the right ferry. So I helped her sort out an Uber and get to where she needed to go. As I later learned, you can't order an Uber for someone else *and* yourself at the same time üòÖ Still, Vancouver's sky train was quite pretty (and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xDNqC45OkVAlFXTfUeuI5bX8pAhPmxy2/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">automatic</a>) &#128558; I was *so* surprised when I got on the train and there was no driver. In any case, no regrets and I'm really glad I chose to not just sit on a train being bored for two days instead of making lots of new friends :-) Maybe I'll see Heidi again some day if the winds take me to Switzerland.

        # Vancouver

        ![Skyline of downtown Vancouver near Stanley Park](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/vancouver/skyline.webp)
        <figcaption>Skyline of downtown Vancouver near Stanley Park. I was watching seaplanes land and take off from the harbour.</figcaption>

        I rationally say Vancouver was just like Toronto. Still traffic and noise on the streets. And **from up close, a lake looks like an ocean**. But WOW, did I ever get graced by the gift of meeting incredible people during my two weeks there. After the desert of Edmonton (metaphorically *and* it was literally 40 degrees when I was there &#128548;), the oceans of Vancouver are much appreciated in retrospect.

        ## AP and AS

        AP and AS were my AirBnB flatmates, alongside this adorable little treasure, Foxy \<3.

        </video>
        <figcaption>Foxy loved tug. I loved Foxy :D</figcaption>

        They were a couple who'd just arrived in Canada three days ago and taught me a lot about the struggles of new immigrants in Canada. I heard their concerns with banking companies, finding housing, even day to day basics like buying furniture without having a car to drive it to their place. Until I listened, I just couldn't realise what I assumed and took for granted. 

        Sharing about our culture with each other, we became very good friends\! I'd learn surprising things like how AP and AS watched bollywood movies like me &#128064; As AP taught me, the Ukrainian film industry is relatively small, so bollywood and hollywood films are more commonly watched. AP told me he liked the "colour and energy" of bollywood films, which I guess I'd never thought of since I can understand Hindi and was too busy listening to the dialogue. I really hope they get to visit Toronto one day so I can also share Indian food I like with them :-)

        I also learned a lot from asking them about their family in Ukraine. It taught me about how humans are simultaneously different, yet connected \- and that's the most beautiful way for things to be. For example, I'd *hear* AS tell me about feeling a constant stress knowing her parents lived in a city on the battlefront. Though I knew I'd never *understand* what she was trying to tell me until I lived it. At the same time, I was lucky to listen to AP telling me about his worries trying to choose which apartment to rent given hidden terms he didn't understand. After talking to me, he'd try to manage a *fourth* language to tell me: "It feels good‚Ä¶ just to be heard from somebody." I happily told him about the word "venting" in English. I was happy because **even with our different origins and different languages, I understood what he was feeling. Because that feeling wasn't Ukrainian or Canadian, that feeling was human**. 

        ## Natalie

        Even as I write this, I can't help but grinning and shaking my head in disbelief at the things we got up to. Natalie was a schoolmate of mine when I was still in middle school. Back in the day, she used to be timid, respectful, ‚Ä¶ the kind of person I expected to end up in a career where I said "Oh, that's quite nice for her; I'm glad she's doing well." I moved out East, she moved out West, and 8 years later, I thought it'd be nice to check up on her since we'd talked online a few times. 

        WOW, was I ever surprised at what happened next &#128558;

        I sent her a message feeling kind of nervous reaching out and asking to meet up in Vancouver after all these years. In my head, that was a trust fall moment. She replies and essentially says: "Yay\! Let me get my diving board\!"  
        ![A cartoon of a trust fall](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/vancouver/trustfall.png)

        As of writing, Natalie's currently working as an outdoor educator in the middle of nowhere on Vancouver Island. She proceeded to then invite me to cross the Salish sea and travel 300 km to reach aforementioned-middle-of-nowhere for a weekend trip. Either I was about to get murdered or have a memory of a lifetime. So I said: "You're only young once" and just went &#128064;

        Foreshadowing: I wasn't murdered &#128517; I actually had an incredible time. When I first saw Natalie, it was like the happiest person I've seen in the world showed up from some happier-ever-after Disney fairy tale wearing bright clothes and singing to herself as we walked. She said she wanted to run some errands and pick up some books... an hour later, I was trying to bribe my new pal Jonathan (the owner of the bookstore) to try and get her out of there &#128548;

        When we got to Natalie's camp, it was calm and pretty.   
        ![The lake and mountains at Natalie's camp](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/vancouver/lodge.webp)
        <figcaption>Can't beat here for a sunrise to wake up to :-)</figcaption>

        I wanted to talk to her to figure out all the things that had changed in 8 years. She kept suggesting outdoorsy non-talking activities we could do with the energy of a hamster who'd eaten a _whole_ sugar cube &#128514;

        We reached a compromise to canoe out to the middle of the lake and then we would talk. It was literally my second time in life in a canoe, so I was pretty careful. The funniest moment that evening was when she daintily picked up the canoe (strength of an ox &#128558;), cheerfully stepped onboard, and flipped the canoe LITERALLY two seconds after she stepped in &#128513; I was like, "Ummmm‚Ä¶ I'm pretty sure we need you to be the expert between the two of us???"   
        ![Hanging the canoe out to dry](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/vancouver/canoe.webp)
        <figcaption>Leaving the canoe out to dry in the sun. I'd gotten the hang of paddling by then :-)</figcaption>

        After getting rid of the giggles, Natalie taught me how to steer a canoe. It was pretty fun, though I have to admit I was thinking about control systems and hysteresis off in engineering land &#128513; When we got back, we learned a fun board game with Natalie's friends where I was doing supply chain analysis, David and Emma were being the resident comedians, Carly was being the friendly host, and Natalie/Abbio were being the silent schemers secretly inching closer to victory &#128064; After dinner, Natalie and I played a game called <a href="https://www.notion.so/Existential-Questions-Courtesy-of-Mishaal-Lakhani-adf8a45ef00942c1a732c698c75b7fa6" target="_blank">We're Not Really Strangers</a> where we ask each other deep questions. I told her about my habit of discomfort challenges. So she challenged me to go to a party dressed as a traffic sign wearing her neon mountain climbing gear. I told her I would if she went in a surfsuit &#128541; A lot of persuasive non-persuasion later, she agreed.   
        
        It was interesting for me to note how much I didn't care what anyone thought of me because I knew I'd be out of there the very next day. The only thing that made me nervous was how nervous she was; I don't usually 'call out' / challenge people based on what they tell me they value / where they want to grow. I've only done it two times (very scientific sample size) and both times I noted people start acting very unlike their 'usual' self. In this case, it seemed like a switch had gone off and all Natalie could think about was what I'd said. I really mean this literally; the conversation was like: "Me: monologue. Natalie: previous topic. Me: monologue. Natalie: previous topic. Me: You okay? Natalie: previous topic." &#128558; 
        
        So a disorienting while later, we're outside the party in the dark and now I'm trying to persuasively non-persuade her to stop and make sure she actually wants to do this so she doesn't have regrets... Suddenly, she just runs in the room :OOOOO I just do my routine of being unashamed, dancing like a stick, staying for four songs (which is one more than the bare minimum, mind you), and then going to sleep because my bedtime is 10 PM and it's midnight, thank you very much.   

        <button data-src="/blog/2024-summer-travels/audio/vancouver/Alive (40s).mp3" class="narration-button">
            Much respect to Natalie
        </button>

        For Natalie, it's like another switch went off. I have never seen someone dance like she did. She danced like the visual incarnation of music, just flowing in this way that I can only describe as <a href="https://www.zenpencils.com/comic/83-howard-thurman-ask-yourself/" target="_blank">truly alive</a>. It gave me a memory of my own to understand what the movie <a href="https://youtu.be/vbBVrfkFe2I?si=LR7dNq5X6gtY02ej&t=38" target="_blank">Soul was trying to show</a>: the revelation and beauty of regular old living.

        # Interlude B: Art

        ![Inside the Remai Modern in Saskatoon](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/art/remaiModernNeon.webp)
        <figcaption>Inside the Remai Modern in Saskatoon. Honestly, the most memorable museum I've ever been to.</figcaption>

        ## My inspirations
        Of all things I expected to learn during my adventures, turning into an art connoisseur was not at the top of my list &#128517; I've always had an appreciation for art. When I 'program' multimedia reflections like these, it's not conventional art. Yet when I do it for no reason other than 'I want to make something pretty' \- I **consider that pursuit of creating something impractical, yet beautiful to be art**. In that sense, I'm an artist. Yet I couldn't recite periods of art or artists I like. Or at least, I couldn't *have* before this trip.

        During the trip, I was quite lucky to visit several art museums across Canada. I could spend as much time as I wanted looking at the art that interested me instead of roaming through hallways upon hallways of boring portraits. Much of what I saw was unique and actually inspired the format of this reflection. 

        * In Qu√©bec, I adored "Le son du rap Qu√©becois" \- an exhibition at the Mus√©e de la Civilisation. It presented the evolution of rap music in Qu√©bec, starting from English rappers travelling from New York to Montr√©al. More importantly, it presented this musical exposition *via* music. I didn't just read text or look at objects. The entire time, I had on headphones that would play music of different eras as I walked through the exhibit. The musicians featured in the exhibition would speak to each listener to describe _how_ they created their art. As I'm sure you've guessed, I *adored* the immersion of that format and decided to make that come to life through this site. All the songs you've been hearing throughout the reflection are songs that I listened to while on a plane to Winnipeg or train to Edmonton or ferry to Victoria or bus to Campbell River or... 
        * In Saskatoon, I fell in love with the Remai Modern. Easily the best art museum I've ever visited. One of the unique works on display was what seemed like a tech person throwing spaghetti on the wall. This exhibit would sense the real-time weather in the region and play <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ocTD96qDgN9ZcaLSR0k6-isO3yzjFW6U/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">audio based on the weather</a>. I loved that randomness\! A) because it connected technology to art and I've always felt that even technical work can be art. **Art is not about the medium in which you deliver a message, but the intention with which you deliver it**. B) because people always go on about the rarity of this painting or that painting... But how about the rarity of an art piece that will *literally* never be experienced the same way twice? In inspiration of that, the music on this page is randomly ordered. I hope your experience isn't terrible because I have no way of predicting what it will be &#128517;

        With all that inspiration out of the way, here are some new styles of art I first discovered on this trip :-) 

        ## Kentridge and Lithography

        William Kentridge is an artist originally from South Africa who specialises in a unique process called photogravure. His work was featured at the Remai Modern (best art museum I've ever been to), alongside the lithography of Picasso. Photogravure is a bit like lithography; it's about etching patterns onto metal plates via chemical processes. In particular, a photo is printed onto a sheet where it can be soaked in special chemicals. This sheet can then be pressed onto a metal like a copper plate. The darker and lighter areas of the photo will then form different impressions on the metal based on how much ink they had.   
        <img src="/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/art/lithographyPlate.webp" alt="A lithography plate from William Kentridge's works" class="vert" />
        <figcaption>Here's what a lithography plate looks like after the full photogravure process.</figcaption>

        The artist can then directly engrave the sheet of metal (the 'gravure' in photogravure) to form patterns that they like. Once these patterns are etched into the metal, the metal can be coated with paint and pressed onto a piece of paper.   
        ![Variations of a kettle made from different metal plates](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/art/kentridgeKettles.webp)
        <figcaption> The metal plate from above made the top left kettle imprint. It can be hard to see it at first since the imprint is horizontally flipped. Also, the scratches you noticed on the plate are the whitespace, since that's where the black paint <i>didn't</i> go.</figcaption>

        What I first admired about Kentridge's work was the amount of sheer contrast it had. The black and white just grabbed my attention. Also, the thin etches from directly engraving the metal enabled very fine details. Upon closer inspection, I then began to love the dark themes in his work, many of which were informed by his experiences witnessing apartheid in South Africa.   
        ![If you have no eye by William Kentridge](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/art/kentridgeTree.webp)
        <figcaption>I really like the collage snippets alongside the etched tree! I'd encourage you to click/zoom into the image to see the details.</figcaption>

        Thematically and visually, it reminded me of a brazen comic I found at the University of Manitoba's Icelandic collection.   
        <img src="/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/art/whereIsGod.webp" alt="Where is God? by Hugleikur Dagsson" class="vert" />
        <figcaption>A Where's Waldo joke dialled to way more than 11</figcaption>

        When I then learned about photogravure as a process, I was awestruck by the sheer amount of effort and detail it takes to produce the final artwork. Producing the sequential metal plates to apply to the page is like stacking a 3D layered puzzle. An example showing the difficulty involved is with Picasso's works.   
        ![Picasso's Jacqueline au Chapeau de Paille](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/art/picasso.webp)
        <figcaption>Picasso's Jacqueline au Chapeau de Paille. The yellow copy is the only one which requires a single etched plate.</figcaption>

        Each colour in each variant of the painting requires a different metal plate to be engraved with the features desired for that particular colour. I was nerding out about it with the guard on duty in that exhibit. If you ever visit‚Ä¶ this is Canada; yes, you are allowed to make friends with guards without security worries. And you'll make both your days more interesting while you're at it :-)

        ## Inuit Carvings

        When I'd seen past Indigenous art, it had been vibrant-coloured paintings of animals from cultures like the Wendat, Anishinaabe, and Cree. Given how much I like contrast, I really liked this style of artwork.  
        ![A vibrant mural at the Manitoba Museum](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/art/indigenousMural.webp)
        <figcaption>A vibrant mural at the Manitoba Museum. The contrasting colours and abstract animals are common in the art of many tribes in that region.</figcaption>

        In the Winnipeg Art Gallery, however, I was lucky to witness how different Inuit bone carvings were from the prior art. Many pieces I saw had abstract depictions of everyday life etched onto whale bones. I found it very mesmerising to lean close and squint towards the small symbols, only to piece together the details and be fascinated by depictions of narwhales, hunting, etc.  
        ![Carvings on a horn depicting whale hunting and reindeer sleds](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/art/boneHorn.webp)

        <figcaption>Carvings on a pipe - many indigenous artists at the time made showpieces like this to sell to European traders</figcaption>
        
        Other pieces carved the bones into intricate forms themselves. Some had grotesque faces for use in spiritual rituals. One piece that I was especially impressed by had incredible intricacy as it carved a whole antler down to represent wispy curves of wind.

        I'd say the words that summarised my experience in this exhibition of the Winnipeg Art Gallery would be 'detail' and 'discovery'. The whole exhibition had an ambiance of poise and significance to it.

        ## Maquettes

        In Victoria, I went to a rather unique place called Miniature Worlds. They mainly make models of historical scenes, like this depiction of the US civil war.
        ![A miniature model of the US civil war](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/art/miniatureWorldWar.webp)
        <figcaption>A miniature model of the US civil war. Some details were astounding, like using cotton to mimic smoke after gunfire.</figcaption> 
        
        Though there was this incredible outlier which was a moving scifi space station. It was in a dark room so you couldn't see any suspension cables and everything felt like it was floating in space.

            <source src="/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/art/miniatureWorldSpace.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>

        <figcaption>No this is not an animation. It's real!</figcaption>

        I found that the historical models were more informative than creative. Still, I quite liked the aesthetics of <a href="https://youtu.be/05zFiWA1Gxs" target="_blank">day-night sequences</a> represented in the many cities recreated. It really made the models feel 'encompassing' \- like you could stay there and just observe life unfolding in different eras. 

        In Winnipeg, I also found a much more artistically-full model called '*The Wagon*'. A stranger viewing the model liked it so much, he stopped to talk to me about the symbolism involved. As one example, I took a VIA train with various cars across Canada, meeting lots of new people. Though it's increasingly easier to be alone and not go out of your bubble to talk to people these days. The artist represented this by having the VIA train pulling individual camper wagons instead of shared train wagons. I'll leave you to <a href="https://youtu.be/vQbVkGbXb4k" target="_blank">spot the other misanthropic themes</a> &#128513;

        By the time I got to Victoria, the 1.5 months of travelling were starting to get me pretty tired. I generally avoided tourism and focused on learning about people. Still, I can't resist sharing this montage of plants from the Finnerty Gardens at the University of Victoria. Best botanical garden I visited during my trip!

        ## AirBnB Hosts

        My AirBnB hosts were a family of brothers and sisters born in a very different time and place than me. At the start, there were quite a few eyebrow-raising differences in our vocabularies where I was left thinking, "I'm pretty sure you're nice people, so I'm pretty sure you're not trying to say what that term means these days &#128550;" 

        As I learned over time, they are nice people who grew up in difficult circumstances. It just took some patience and compassion on my end to slow down and seek to understand instead of flinching away. As one of the less personal examples, one of my hosts brought up their beliefs on vaccination safety and my first reaction was: "I really don't want to continue this conversation." Still, I controlled my actions and instead sought to listen and try to understand where they had heard what they had heard in a non-judgemental manner. My host explained how they had heard a friend mention a blog post or how their sister had a conversation at the grocery store, which led them to their present beliefs. 

        <button data-src="/blog/2024-summer-travels/audio/victoria/Learning to listen (1m).mp3" class="narration-button">
            Learning to listen
        </button>

        Listening when you want to judge, this isn't easy or natural or automatic. Though it's more effective than just saying, "No, you're wrong. What I believe is‚Ä¶" **If we can't even suppress our tribal hatred instincts long enough to listen, do we deserve to think we're rational while 'the other' isn't?**

        ## Tristan

        Tristan led the local AI club at the University of Victoria. I just randomly sent him a message on Discord, not knowing what to expect when we met up. As it turned out, it was one of those conversations where we lost track of time and the conversation itself was the thrill of the day. I don't know why exactly I use the word thrill, because it's not like some amusement park ride or adrenaline rush. It was just **this satisfaction with the present moment to the point where you forget about anything else except an eagerness to see what comes next :-)** 

        We talked about so many things for two hours straight. Similarities in our personalities, similarities in the way we grew up. Talking about culture and the world and our place within it. Big talk, small plans, small talk, big plans \- it was just a quiet, simple, shared appreciation for life. It's not so easy to predict when you'll meet the kind of person where everything will just be easy and 'click'. But when that big wave comes, you just thank the oceans and pull all your attention back to the present for the surf of a lifetime.

        # Calgary

        ![Fish creek Provincial Park, Marshall Springs](/blog/2024-summer-travels/img/calgary/fishCreekPark.webp)
        <figcaption>Fish Creek Provincial Park, Marshall Springs. I used to spend hours wandering around here every week when I was a teen.</figcaption>

        When my family first moved to Canada, we used to live in Calgary. I grew up in a lot of cities, but the one I most associate with 'hometown' feelings is Calgary. It was my great privilege to be able to see several of my old classmates from middle school again after seven years. Happiness vibes through the roof. Also sadness / nostalgia underneath the basement.

        ## Andre

        The first person I met in Calgary was my closest friend from middle school. Andre and I used to go hiking in Fish Creek Provincial Park, be angsty tweens walking around the school at lunch, rollerblade around our neighbourhood (which seemed oh so worldly big at the time), and so much more. It was one of the times in life where I remembered simply feeling carelessly happy. I could just run around in circles in a park and be happy for no reason. **In adult life, the type of happiness changed; it's not carelessly happy, it's happiness in-spite-of**. I can feel happy, but it's in spite of X, Y, Z in my head. 

        Anyways, when I first ran into Andre, it struck me as odd how things were different compared to when we were in middle school. We both knew the other had changed but we didn't precisely know *how* the other had changed. Still, initial awkwardness out of the way, we had good conversations about the ups and downs of life since we'd last seen each other. He now studies biology, which I only mention to set up forthcoming jokes &#128513;

        One evening, I just randomly messaged him to go on our careless adventures again and visit Fish Creek provincial park and the pond with the ducks and muskrat. I offered astute observations such as "You know, we're probably looking at the ancestor ducks of the ducks we used to see when we were kids" and "What are biologists good for if they can't tell me what the plural of muskrat is?"
        
        We then decided to drive to our old middle school at 10 PM. I offered quality grandfather banter such as: "This is where the buses would use to line up and they would stretch around the *whole* block\!" We relived a lot of memories just seeing the different places around the school where we would hang out. Each bench, rock, basketball hoop had a different story. We ended off the night sad that our very reasonable request of walking inside the school in the summer at 10 PM at night couldn't be fulfilled...

        We wrapped up the trip by driving out to Banff on my last day in Calgary. It was gorgeous‚Ä¶ nuff said.

        ## Daniel

        When I first arrived in Canada, suffice it to say I was FRESH OFF. My condolences to teachers that had to try and deal with me as I figured out what to say and do. I guess one of my teachers must have taken pity on me in elementary school since she assigned me a 'welcome buddy', who was Daniel. Daniel would introduce me to friends, be the first person I ask questions to, etc.

        Unfortunately, I don't remember too much from that time period. Daniel and I were classmates in middle school, but we didn't talk all that much. So when I reached out after 7 years, with both of us now in university, I didn't know what to expect. Though I was SO glad I reached out! Throughout the *entire* trip, I have not met *anyone* as happy as he was :-)
        
        I'm happy to report that Daniel is now almost about to graduate, has his own apartment, has moved in with his girlfriend, and just radiates positivity like you would not believe. I don't get to hear about good things happening to others enough so maybe this was just all the pent up emotion. But talking to him, I was thinking of all the people I grew up with like, "Finally\! One of us made it\!\!\!" It does help a lot in these tumultuous times. Just to know there's happiness, not just 'somewhere out there', but in your little corner of the world.

        ## Family Friends

        There's a big difference between knowing someone for ages and meeting them again after a long time. When you know someone for ages, it's easy to take things for granted. Appreciating gives way to bickering. **It's easy to forget to be thankful if you don't know when it'll be gone**. 

        That's one of the upsides of moving a lot. As I say about my university program, having four months to study and four months to work keeps **forcing me to appreciate the current phase of life, since that phase comes with a deadline**. With my travels, I accelerated that to appreciating every day since I was moving to a new city every week. And when I saw old family friends of ours after a long time, it was nothing but good feelings since we didn't have a minute to spare. Seven years of history to make up for in a few hours. 

        Most of my experience can be summed up by saying that I still feel like a kid in life. I don't feel like I'm ready to witness the enormous changes occuring in the world, but life waits for no one. I visited the house of one of my family friends and saw the same sofa where I'd sat holding their baby seven years ago. The baby was now a tall tween for her age &#128558; She didn't have a personality when I was holding her seven years ago. The most interesting thing to notice was, "Wow, her nose is the size of my pinky" Now, she's a human with thoughts and feelings and her own personality. The miracle of life and growth in a way I'd never felt as a kid. And yet, in the same week, we learned our former neighbour's mother was going to die of cancer with a week left to live. 

        It made me stop to appreciate time. The clock is ticking for all of us at the same pace. It doesn't matter if we use that time to grow, to cry, to stand, to pass, to feel, to drown, to jump, or to jolt.

        <blockquote>Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.</blockquote>

        After such a long time jumping from city to city every *week*, I can't believe I'm going to be staying in one city for the next *four months* while at university. Yes, I know moving every four months seems crazy to the rest of the normal population, but it seems like forever after what I've been through &#128517; 

        I keep thinking, "No meeting immigrants? No sneaking into clubs and locked buildings in universities I'm not supposed to be in?? No heartbreak??? No midnight dances dressed as a traffic sign in places I've never heard of????"

        When I first thought of this, I was really sad and I missed all the friends I'd made from around the world. Then, my brain got to scheming again &#128513; Human imagination is quite a dual-sided blade. It can weigh me down as I reminisce about the faces I'll never get to see again. It can lift me up as I imagine screaming "@\#^\# IT\!\!\!\!" into the wind and starting driving and not stopping until I see all the oceans. It can keep me afloat as I ignore my math homework and instead run a comedy night at my university instead &#128541; 

        I've had what some would call an adventure of a lifetime. Some would be happy to rest in their laurels and tell these stories to their grandkids. Me, I don't know whether I'll be alive another 8 months or 80 years. **Friends, money, fame, power \- it all comes and goes. But I'll never get another second beyond what I've been gifted**. Life isn't some destination to have seen and cross off. The only sensible thing to do then is to stop lying around and go CHASE after it.   
        
        <div class="life-motto">
            "To *see* the world, things dangerous to *come* to,  
            to *see* behind walls, to *draw closer*,   
            to *find* each other and to *feel*.  
            That is the purpose of life." \- artsy impact HUGE letters taking up the screen
